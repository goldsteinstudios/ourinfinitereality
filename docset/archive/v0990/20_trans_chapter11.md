## Chinese Text

> 三十輻共一轂，當其無，有車之用。
> 埏埴以為器，當其無，有器之用。
> 鑿戶牖以為室，當其無，有室之用。
> 故有之以為利，無之以為用。

## Translation

**三十輻共一轂，當其無，有車之用。**
Thirty spokes share one hub;
Where it is nothing, there is the cart's function.

**埏埴以為器，當其無，有器之用。**
Knead clay to make vessels;
Where it is nothing, there is the vessel's function.

**鑿戶牖以為室，當其無，有室之用。**
Carve doors and windows to make a room;
Where it is nothing, there is the room's function.

**故有之以為利，無之以為用。**
Therefore: Substance provides the harvest-capacity (the π-operation),
Emptiness provides the operational function (the void that enables motion).

## Key Terms

| Character | Pinyin | Structural Reading |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 輻 | fú | spoke (radiates from void to rim) |
| 轂 | gǔ | hub (contains the axle-void) |
| 無 | wú | void, nothing (generative, not absence) |
| 用 | yòng | function, capacity (what void provides) |
| 埏 | shān | knead (working substrate) |
| 埴 | zhí | clay (malleable earth) |
| 器 | qì | vessel (openings guarding emptiness) |
| 鑿 | záo | carve (subtract material) |
| 室 | shì | room (space you can arrive into) |
| 利 | lì | harvest-capacity, π-operation (scythe arc) |
| 有 | yǒu | substance, form, presence |

---

## The 利 Correction

利 lì = 禾 hé (standing grain) + 刀 dāo (blade)

Previous translations: "advantage," "profit," "benefit" — abstract nouns

Structural reading: **The scythe operation** — the arc that sweeps through the field

| Reading | Operation | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Knife | Linear push | One stalk at a time, exhausting |
| Scythe | π-sweep | Swath per stroke, completing |

---

## The Formula

```
有之以為利 = Structure provides harvest-capacity
             (the blade that can execute π-operations)

無之以為用 = Emptiness provides operational function
             (the void through which arcs sweep)

有 → 利 → 無 → 用
Structure → cut → void → function
```

## Three Demonstrations

| Object | 有 (form) | 無 (void) | 用 (function) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Wheel | Spokes | Hub | Rotation |
| Vessel | Clay walls | Interior | Containment |
| Room | Walls | Carved space | Dwelling |

*All demonstrate the same principle: Structure exists to perform the cut that maintains the void.*
