  - element: "可/常 as frame-dependent/frame-independent"

    note: "Consistent with Guodian 恆 (héng) variant. Structural reading produces coherent framework across chapters."

    note: "The cut that creates both poles. Consistent with Chapter 2's 相生 demonstration."

## Chinese Text

> 道可道，非常道。
> 名可名，非常名。
> 無名天地之始；
> 有名萬物之母。
> 故常無欲以觀其妙；
> 常有欲以觀其徼。
> 此兩者同出而異名，
> 同謂之玄。
> 玄之又玄，眾妙之門。

## Translation

**道可道，非常道**
Manifest dao ←非→ implicit dao.

**名可名，非常名**
Manifest distinction ←非→ implicit distinction.

**無名天地之始**
Named-nothing — void distinguished from form — origins the dimensional field.

**有名萬物之母**
Named-something — form distinguished from void — mothers all measurable things.

**故常無欲以觀其妙**
Therefore: orient toward implicit-nothing to observe relational patterns.

**常有欲以觀其徼**
Orient toward implicit-something to observe boundaries.

**此兩者同出而異名**
These two emerge together yet illuminate differently.

**同謂之玄**
Together they are called the paradoxical origin.

**玄之又玄，眾妙之門**
Paradox within paradox — the gateway to all patterns.

## Key Terms

| Character | Pinyin | Structural Reading |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 道 | dào | dao (untranslated — exists in both modes) |
| 可 | kě | manifest / explicit / frame-dependent |
| 常 | cháng | implicit / frame-independent / pre-distinction |
| 非 | fēi | ←非→ divergence from shared center |
| 名 | míng | distinction / the operation that differentiates |
| 無 | wú | nothing / void (as origin, not absence) |
| 有 | yǒu | something / form / presence |
| 欲 | yù | orientation / focus (not "desire") |
| 妙 | miào | relational patterns (fix center, vary boundary) |
| 徼 | jiào | boundaries (fix boundary, vary center) |
| 玄 | xuán | paradoxical origin / generative center |

## The Two Registers

| Register | Mode | What Exists Here |
|----------|------|------------------|
| **常** (implicit) | Pre-distinction | 常無, 常有 — observation stances |
| **可** (manifest) | Post-distinction | 無名, 有名 — distinguished coordinates |

---

## The Observation Stances

| Stance | Operation | What You Perceive |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **常無欲** | Fix center, vary boundary | **妙** — relational patterns, flows |
| **常有欲** | Fix boundary, vary center | **徼** — edges, where things stop |

*Neither stance produces knowledge derivable from the other. They are geometrically orthogonal.*

*This is the coordinate system. Everything that follows navigates through it.*
