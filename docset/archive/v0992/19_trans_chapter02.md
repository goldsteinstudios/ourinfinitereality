## Chinese Text

> 天下皆知美之為美，斯惡已；
> 皆知善之為善，斯不善已。
> 故有無相生，難易相成，長短相形，高下相傾，音聲相和，前後相隨。
> 是以聖人處無為之事，行不言之教。
> 萬物作焉而不辭，生而不有，為而不恃，功成而弗居。
> 夫唯弗居，是以不去。

---

## Translation

**天下皆知美之為美，斯惡已**
When the distinction "beautiful" is drawn, "not-beautiful" co-emerges at that instant.

**皆知善之為善，斯不善已**
When the distinction "good" is drawn, "not-good" co-emerges at that instant.

**故有無相生**
Therefore: being and non-being co-generate each other.

**難易相成**
Difficult and easy co-complete each other.

**長短相形**
Long and short co-define each other.

**高下相傾**
High and low co-incline toward each other.

**音聲相和**
Organized tone and raw sound co-harmonize.

**前後相隨**
Before and after co-follow each other.

**是以聖人處無為之事，行不言之教**
This is why the sage abides in non-forcing action and practices wordless teaching.

**萬物作焉而不辭**
The ten thousand things arise, and there is no refusing them.

**生而不有**
Generating without possessing.

**為而不恃**
Acting without relying on the result.

**功成而弗居**
Achievement complete, not dwelling in it.

**夫唯弗居，是以不去**
Precisely by not dwelling, it does not depart.

|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 美 | měi | beautiful (pole created by distinction) |

| 善 | shàn | good (pole created by distinction) |
| 相 | xiāng | mutual, reciprocal, each-other |

| 傾 | qīng | incline, lean toward |
| 和 | hé | harmonize, blend |

## RSM v0.988 Mapping

| DDJ Element | RSM Mapping | Principle |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Drawing distinction | 名 = i | Orthogonal cut creates both poles |
| 相生 (mutual arising) | Postulate 4: X·Y=k | Reciprocal constraint |
| Six pairs | Same structure, different domains | Universal pattern |
| 弗居→不去 | 反 = +1 | Return enables persistence |

---

## The Six Demonstrations

All six pairs use 相 (mutual/reciprocal) + bidirectional verb:

| Pair | Verb | Structure |
|------|------|-----------|
| 有/無 | 相生 | co-generate |
| 難/易 | 相成 | co-complete |
| 長/短 | 相形 | co-define |
| 高/下 | 相傾 | co-incline |
| 音/聲 | 相和 | co-harmonize |
| 前/後 | 相隨 | co-follow |

*Each demonstrates: draw boundary → both sides co-emerge → neither exists independently.*

---

## What This Is NOT Saying

❌ "Beauty doesn't exist"
❌ "Good and evil are illusions"
❌ "Nothing matters because it's all relative"
❌ "Don't make distinctions"

## What This IS Saying

✓ Every distinction creates both poles simultaneously
✓ Neither pole exists independently of the other
✓ Both poles are real once the boundary is drawn
✓ The boundary itself is a generative act
✓ This is mechanics, not morality

---

## The Closing Formula

```
弗居 (not dwelling) → 不去 (not departing)

Release completion → Pattern persists through transformation
Grip completion → Collapse
```

*Consistent with 反 = return. The tree releases its leaves; spring returns.*
