## Chinese Text

> 道生一，一生二，二生三，三生萬物。
> 萬物負陰而抱陽，沖氣以為和。

*(Lines 3-5 omitted — political commentary, not structural)*

## Translation

**道生一**
Pattern and distinction co-emerge.

**一生二**
Distinction and polarity co-emerge.

**二生三**
Polarity and closure co-emerge.

**三生萬物**
Closure and manifestation co-emerge continuously.

**萬物負陰而抱陽**
All things carry void on their backs and embrace form in front.

**沖氣以為和**
Blending circulation to create harmony.

## Key Terms

| Character | Pinyin | Structural Reading |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 道 | dào | pattern (undifferentiated, pre-distinction) |
| 生 | shēng | co-emerge (mutual arising, not linear cause) |
| 一 | yī | one/distinction (O₁, first "something") |
| 二 | èr | two/polarity (two poles of one axis) |
| 三 | sān | three/closure (minimum for spherical completion) |
| 萬物 | wàn wù | ten thousand things (all manifestation) |
| 陰 | yīn | void-aspect, what's behind, the hollow |
| 陽 | yáng | form-aspect, what's in front, the boundary |
| 沖 | chōng | blend, circulate, flow between |
| 和 | hé | harmony (dynamic balance, not stasis) |

## RSM v0.988 Mapping

| Sequence | RSM | What Happens |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| 道生一 | V₀ → O₁ | Absolute void (V₀) necessitates structural placeholder (O₁) |
| 一生二 | O₁ → G₁ | Origin creates gradient (center/periphery) |
| 二生三 | G₁ → P₁ | Polarity requires closure (3D minimum) |
| 三生萬物 | P₁ → O₂... | Each point becomes new origin (recursion) |

---

## The Critical Stop

The text does NOT say:
- 三生四 (three generates four)
- 四生五 (four generates five)

It says: **三生萬物** (three → everything)

Why? Because three dimensions are **sufficient**. Once you have spherical closure:
- Every point can become a new origin
- Recursion replaces additional dimensions
- 萬物 is infinite instantiation of 三, not a fourth stage

---

## Why Three?

| Dimensions | Structure | Status |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 (line) | No closure | Unstable |
| 2 (plane) | Circle only | Can't bound 3D void |
| 3 (sphere) | Complete closure | **Sufficient** |
| 4+ | Redundant | Recursion already provides |

## The 陰/陽 Demonstration

```
萬物負陰而抱陽
   ↓
All things have:
- Back (陰): the void, the hollow center
- Front (陽): the form, the boundary
- Between: circulation (沖氣以為和)

= Postulate 4 in action: X·Y=k
Neither exists without the other
```

## What This Is NOT Saying

❌ Creation myth: "First there was Dao, then One appeared..."
❌ Temporal sequence: "Step by step, long ago"
❌ Numerology: "Three is a magic number"

## What This IS Saying

✓ Structural necessity: Each stage co-emerges with the next
✓ Dimensional sufficiency: Three is where closure happens
✓ Continuous operation: Present tense, always happening
✓ Recursion: 三生萬物 means infinite nesting, not more dimensions
