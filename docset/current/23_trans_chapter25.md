## Chinese Text

> 有物混成，先天地生。
> 寂兮寥兮，獨立不改，周行而不殆，可以為天下母。
> 吾不知其名，字之曰道，強為之名曰大。
> 大曰逝，逝曰遠，遠曰反。
> 故道大，天大，地大，王亦大。
> 域中有四大，而王居其一焉。
> 人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。

## Translation

**有物混成，先天地生**
Something formed from mixing, prior to heaven-earth emerging.

**寂兮寥兮，獨立不改**
Silent and empty, standing alone without changing.

**周行而不殆，可以為天下母**
Circulating without exhausting—it can mother all under heaven.

**吾不知其名，字之曰道，強為之名曰大**
I don't know its name; I style it "pattern"; forced to name it, I call it "totality."

**大曰逝，逝曰遠，遠曰反**
Totality extends → extension reaches boundary → boundary returns.

**故道大，天大，地大，王亦大**
Therefore: pattern is great, heaven is great, earth is great, the conscious agent is also great.

**域中有四大，而王居其一焉**
In the domain are four great ones; the conscious agent is one of them.

**人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然**
Humans follow earth; earth follows heaven; heaven follows pattern; pattern follows self-so.

## Key Terms

| Character | Pinyin | Structural Reading |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 混成 | hùn chéng | formed from mixing (undifferentiated) |
| 獨立不改 | dú lì bù gǎi | stands alone, doesn't alter (frame-independent) |
| 周行 | zhōu xíng | circulates, orbits (sustainable oscillation) |
| 大 | dà | totality, unbounded field (arms extended) |
| 逝 | shì | extends, goes forth (continuous motion) |
| 遠 | yuǎn | far, reaches boundary (maximum extension) |
| 反 | fǎn | returns, reverses (= +1 in Euler) |
| 王 | wáng | conscious agent (connects 天/人/地) |
| 自然 | zì rán | self-so (spontaneous, no external reference) |

## The Recursion Formula

```
大 → 逝 → 遠 → 反 → (new cycle)
↓     ↓     ↓    ↓
O₁    G     P    +1
origin extend bound return
```

| Stage | Character | RSM | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|-----|--------------|
| 大 | totality | O₁ | Origin establishes |
| 逝 | extends | G | Gradient radiates |
| 遠 | boundary | P | Periphery reached |
| 反 | returns | +1 | Cycle completes, new origin possible |

## The Law of Following (Recursion Nesting)

```
人法地    Humans operate within earth-frame
地法天    Earth operates within heaven-frame
天法道    Heaven operates within pattern-frame
道法自然  Pattern operates as self-so (no external reference)
```

Not hierarchy. **Recursion nesting.** Each level follows the constraints of its containing frame.

**自然** = zì rán = "self-thus" = what emerges when nothing imposes external order.

## What This Is NOT Saying

❌ "The Dao is really big and important"
❌ Linear progression: Dao → One thing → Many things
❌ Cosmological creation story

## What This IS Saying

✓ The recursion formula operates at every scale
✓ Even infinity has dynamics (大 still oscillates)
✓ 反 (return) completes the cycle, enabling the next
✓ Pattern follows no external reference—it is self-so

## Manuscript Note

Guodian bamboo slips (c. 300 BCE) organize content thematically, not by chapter number. The 大→逝→遠→反 formula may appear in different locations across manuscripts.

The structural pattern holds regardless of placement.
