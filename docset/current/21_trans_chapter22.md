## Chinese Text

> 曲則全，枉則直，窪則盈，弊則新，少則得，多則惑。
> 是以聖人抱一為天下式。
> 不自見，故明；不自是，故彰；不自伐，故有功；不自矜，故長。
> 夫唯不爭，故天下莫能與之爭。
> 古之所謂「曲則全」，豈虛言哉？誠全而歸之。

## Translation

**曲則全，枉則直，窪則盈，弊則新，少則得，多則惑**
What bends → preserves wholeness.
What accepts distortion → finds straightness.
What hollows → becomes filled.
What wears out → renews.
What has little → obtains.
What has much → becomes confused.

**是以聖人抱一為天下式**
Therefore the one who perceives clearly embraces unity as the pattern for all under heaven.

**不自見，故明；不自是，故彰；不自伐，故有功；不自矜，故長**
Not self-displaying → thus illuminated.
Not self-affirming → thus manifest.
Not self-promoting → thus achieving.
Not self-aggrandizing → thus enduring.

**夫唯不爭，故天下莫能與之爭**
Only through not-contending does all-under-heaven become unable to contend with it.

**古之所謂「曲則全」，豈虛言哉？誠全而歸之**
What the ancients called "bending preserves wholeness"—how could this be empty words? Through genuine wholeness, return to it.

## Key Terms

| Character | Pinyin | Structural Reading |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 曲 | qū | bend, curve (distributes stress) |
| 則 | zé | thus, transformation operator (not "should") |
| 全 | quán | whole, complete (integrity preserved) |
| 抱 | bào | embrace, hold close |
| 一 | yī | one, unity (the origin point) |
| 式 | shì | pattern, formula, model |
| 不自X | bù zì X | not self-X (non-occupation of position) |
| 爭 | zhēng | contend, grasp (hands grasping) |
| 歸 | guī | return (echoes 反) |

## The Six Transformations

| Input | 則 | Output | Principle |
|-------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 曲 (bent) | → | 全 (whole) | Curvature distributes stress |
| 枉 (crooked) | → | 直 (straight) | Accepting deviation enables return |
| 窪 (hollow) | → | 盈 (full) | Low points accumulate flow |
| 弊 (worn) | → | 新 (new) | Exhaustion enables renewal |
| 少 (little) | → | 得 (obtaining) | Emptiness creates capacity |
| 多 (much) | → | 惑 (confused) | Excess overwhelms |

First five: yielding → obtaining.
Sixth: accumulating → losing.

## 抱一 — Holding the Origin

```
一 = origin point (0,0,0)

When you hold the origin:
  → all positions accessible
  → all transformations available

When you're identified with a position:
  → can only see from that position
  → must defend that territory
```

式 (shì) = pattern/formula. The sage uses unity as **operational formula** generating appropriate responses.

## The Four Non-Self Operations

| Not Doing | → | Result | Why |
|-----------|---|--------|-----|
| 不自見 (not self-displaying) | → | 明 (illuminated) | Don't occupy viewing position |
| 不自是 (not self-affirming) | → | 彰 (manifest) | Don't occupy reference position |
| 不自伐 (not self-promoting) | → | 功 (achieving) | Don't occupy achievement position |
| 不自矜 (not self-aggrandizing) | → | 長 (enduring) | Don't occupy persistence position |

**Non-occupation enables function.** This is Chapter 11's principle (利 shapes 無 into 用) applied to self-positioning.

---

## 不爭 — Uncontestability

爭 (zhēng) = hands grasping = contention = two parties occupying same position.

When you don't occupy the position:
- Nothing to contest
- No surface to push against
- Can't fight someone who isn't there

This isn't passivity. It's **strategic non-occupation**.

## Connection to 利 (Scythe)

曲則全 = curve completes what straight cannot.

| Approach | Motion | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Rigid (knife) | Linear push | Exhausts, breaks |
| Yielding (scythe) | Arc sweep | Distributes, completes |

The scythe's curve (曲) preserves wholeness (全) through harvest. The knife's straight line exhausts against the field.

## What This Is NOT Saying

❌ "Be humble as a virtue"
❌ "Don't compete because competition is bad"
❌ "The meek shall inherit"

## What This IS Saying

✓ Yielding distributes stress—systems preserve integrity through transformation
✓ Holding the origin makes all positions accessible
✓ Non-occupation enables function
✓ Non-contention makes one uncontestable
✓ This is geometry, not morality
