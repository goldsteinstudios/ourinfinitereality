## Chinese Text

> 人之生也柔弱，其死也堅強。
> 草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁。
> 故堅強者死之徒，柔弱者生之徒。
> 是以兵強則滅，木強則折。
> 強大處下，柔弱處上。

## Translation

**人之生也柔弱，其死也堅強**
When humans live, they are yielding and pliable.
When they die, they are hard and stiff.

**草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁**
When grasses and trees live, they are yielding and tender.
When they die, they are withered and desiccated.

**故堅強者死之徒，柔弱者生之徒**
Therefore: the hard and stiff are followers of death.
The yielding and pliable are followers of life.

**是以兵強則滅，木強則折**
Therefore: when weapons are rigid, they are destroyed.
When wood is rigid, it breaks.

**強大處下，柔弱處上**
The rigid and large occupy the lower position.
The yielding and pliable occupy the upper position.

## Key Terms

| Character | Pinyin | Structural Reading |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 柔 | róu | yielding, flexible, soft |
| 弱 | ruò | pliable (double 弓 = bends and springs back) |
| 堅 | jiān | hard, solid, unyielding |
| 強 | qiáng | stiff, rigid, forceful |
| 脆 | cuì | tender, crisp, flexible |
| 枯槁 | kū gǎo | withered and desiccated |
| 徒 | tú | follower, category member |
| 則 | zé | transformation operator (when X → Y) |
| 處 | chù | occupy position |

## The Material Observation

| State | Property | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 生 (living) | 柔弱 / 柔脆 | Humans bend, plants flex |
| 死 (dead) | 堅強 / 枯槁 | Rigor mortis, dead wood |

*Empirical observation: living tissue is pliable, dead tissue is rigid.*

---

## The Classification

```
堅強者 = 死之徒  (rigid = death's category)
柔弱者 = 生之徒  (yielding = life's category)
```

徒 = category membership. The property indicates class, not prediction.

---

## The Consequence

| Condition | 則 | Result |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| 兵強 (weapons rigid) | → | 滅 (destroyed) |
| 木強 (wood rigid) | → | 折 (breaks) |

**則** marks structural consequence: rigidity → breakage.

---

## The Position

```
強大 (rigid/large) → 處下 (below, foundation)
柔弱 (yielding/pliable) → 處上 (above, functional)
```

- Tree: rigid trunk below, flexible branches above
- Organization: rigid structure foundation, adaptive response functions
- System: fixed base supports, flexible action operates

---

## The Mistranslation

| Traditional | Structural |
|-------------|------------|
| 強 = "strong" (positive) | 強 = rigid (correlates with death) |
| 弱 = "weak" (negative) | 弱 = yielding (correlates with life) |

**The value coding is reversed.** What appears "strong" is in the death-category. What appears "weak" is in the life-category.

## Connection to Framework

| Chapter | Principle | Ch 76 Shows |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 22 | 曲則全 (bend → complete) | 柔弱者生之徒 |
| 40 | 弱者道之用 (yielding is function) | 柔弱處上 |
| 8 | Water yields, persists | Living tissue yields, persists |

## What This Is NOT Saying

❌ "Be flexible so you can win"
❌ "Weakness overcomes strength"
❌ Moral prescription about humility

## What This IS Saying

✓ Living things are materially yielding
✓ Dead things are materially rigid
✓ Rigidity is classified with death
✓ Rigid things break under stress
✓ This is physics, not advice
