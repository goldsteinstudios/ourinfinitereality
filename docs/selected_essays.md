## Start Here

### [Why Water?](./essays/why_water.md)
What an ancient text saw that we forgot to notice. Water doesn't have an agenda—it just responds to conditions. That makes it the cleanest window onto patterns that operate everywhere. The character 治 (zhì) = water + platform = governance as channeling. Dujiangyan: a 2,300-year-old irrigation system that still works because it's aligned with how water actually moves.

### [Euler and the Tao](./essays/euler_tao.md)
e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 as the mathematical Tao Te Ching. The five constants—e, π, i, 1, 0—encode the same recursive structure the ancient text describes. Natural spontaneity (e) rotated through impossible space (iπ), combined with fundamental unity (+1), returns perfectly to the void (=0). This isn't metaphor. It's structural proof.

### [Universal Patterns](./essays/universal_patterns.md)
A guide to seeing the same idea everywhere. One structure expressed through mathematics, physics, biology, and the Tao Te Ching. Different languages, one grammar. The Paradox Center (P₀) shows up as zero, singularity, seed, and 無名 (the nameless source). Same architecture, different domains.

## Going Deeper

### [Scale Invariance](./essays/scale_invariance.md)
Why reality looks the same at every scale. Critical phenomena exhibit irrational exponents because rational ones would create periodic traps. The universe's recursive signature appears in phase transitions, renormalization groups, and fractal structures. The mathematics of "why things don't collapse."

### [Energy as Orbital Density](./essays/energy_orbital_density.md)
Energy as completion rate in a universally irrational recursive rhythm. From Planck's constant to metabolic scaling, why irrational constants (π, e, φ, √2) prevent periodic prisons. Quantum coherence in photosynthesis, golden ratio in quasicrystals, and quarter-power scaling laws across 27 orders of magnitude.

## How to Read These

**If you're new:** Start with "Why Water?" — it's the gentlest on-ramp.

**If you want to test your skepticism:** Jump to [Falsification Criteria](./framework/falsification.md) — what would disprove RSM.

**If you want the full technical framework:** See [Geometry: The Paradox Sphere](./framework/geometry.md) and [Academic Parallels](./framework/academic_parallels.md).

**If you want guided paths:** See [Reading Paths](./reading_paths.md) for routes organized by background.

*These essays present the discovery that the Dao De Jing encodes geometric recursion—not philosophy but pattern documentation. The characters are equations. The radicals are operands. The geometry was always there. We just learned how to compile it.*
