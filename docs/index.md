# Our Infinite Reality

Welcome. This is a workshop exploring whether ancient Chinese texts encode geometric observations that align with modern physics and biology.

The central question: **What if stable structures emerge not from solid foundations, but by organizing around centers that stay empty?**

## What's Here

### Dao De Jing Translations
Structural analysis of the 81 chapters, decomposing each character by its radicals to reveal the observation layer beneath the philosophical overlay.

- [Chapter Index](./translations/chapters/) — 29 chapters completed
- [Living Glossary](./translations/lexicon/) — Character-by-character analysis
- [Meta Documentation](./translations/meta/) — Framework and methodology

### Framework
The Recursive Structural Model (RSM): Origin → Gradient → Periphery → Recursion.

- [RSM Documentation](./translations/meta/recursive_structural_model.md)
- [Academic Parallels](./framework/academic_parallels.md)
- [Falsification Criteria](./framework/falsification.md)

### Cross-Domain Mappings
Where the pattern shows up across disciplines.

- [Physics](./pattern/physics.md) — Quantum, thermodynamics, spacetime
- [Biology](./pattern/biology.md) — Living systems, growth patterns
- [Geometry](./pattern/geometry.md) — Mathematical structures

### Essays
Explorations of specific phenomena through the RSM lens.

- [Why Water?](./essays/why_water.md) — Chapter 8's water metaphor
- [Euler and Dao](./essays/euler_tao.md) — Mathematical resonance
- [Scale Invariance](./essays/scale_invariance.md) — Pattern across scales

## Behind the Scenes

This project is undergoing a major reorganization.

**What's happening:**

1. **Archive recovery** — Years of scattered notes, essays, and explorations are being consolidated from various sources (iCloud, NotebookLM notebooks, old exports)

2. **Domain separation** — Content is being organized into distinct domains: RSM (framework), DDJ (Dao De Jing), Physics, Biology, each with canonical/takes/experimental tiers

3. **CAVP validation** — All recovered material is being evaluated for "Constant Accuracy, Variable Precision" — the RSM principle that reliable observations maintain directional accuracy while precision scales with context

4. **Living documentation** — This isn't a finished product. The translation work continues. Frameworks get refined. The GitHub history shows the full evolution.

**The workflow:**

- Private repo: `dao-de-jing-analyzer` — where work happens
- Public site: `ourinfinitereality.com` — what you're reading now
- Everything versioned, nothing lost

## About This Work

I'm a pattern-recognition enthusiast with no academic credentials. This project is a collaboration with AI — I bring the questions and observations, AI helps test them systematically.

Everything here is alive and changing. If you want to see the thinking evolve, including wrong turns: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/goldsteinstudios/dao-de-jing-analyzer)

## Quick Start

**First taste:** [Chapter 11](./translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md) — wheel, pot, room (function is in the emptiness)

**The framework:** [RSM documentation](./translations/meta/recursive_structural_model.md)

**Reading paths:** [Guided entry points](./reading_paths.md) for different backgrounds
