# Plant Growth Axioms
## RSM Applied to Botanical Structure

*Recovered from April 2025 work*

## Overview

Plant growth provides an ideal test case for RSM because:
1. Growth occurs at observable, localized interfaces (meristems, cambium)
2. Branching patterns are measurable and predictable
3. The energy/mass gradient interaction is visible
4. Time scales are accessible for observation

These axioms make specific, testable predictions about WHERE, WHEN, and HOW plant growth occurs.

## The Ten Axioms of Plant Growth

### Axiom 1: Growth Surface Localization (Gₙ)

> All plant growth emerges at the structural interface where inward mass gradient and outward energy gradient converge. This interface—non-dimensional and infinitely divisible—is the only location where recursion updates can occur. This surface is called Gₙ.

**Physical Expression**:
- Apical meristem (shoot tip)
- Cambium (between bark and wood)
- Root tip meristem

**Key Insight**: Growth doesn't happen "in" tissue — it happens AT the paradox surface between mass accumulation (inward) and energy capture (outward).

---

### Axiom 2: Conditional Divergence

> Recursive updating occurs continuously along Gₙ. However, divergence recursion (e.g., new branch, root, bud) only occurs where a local paradox exceeds the coherence capacity of the current frame. When this threshold is crossed, a new Gₙ₊₁ frame emerges.

**Physical Expression**:
- Branching occurs when local hormone gradients exceed threshold
- Root branching in response to nutrient gradients
- Bud formation at nodes

**Testable Prediction**: Branching frequency correlates with gradient intensity variations along Gₙ surface.

---

### Axiom 3: Rotational Growth

> No linear extension is stable under infinite gradients. When two or more gradients interact (e.g., energy and mass), structural tension curves the recursion into a new orientation. This curvature is not motion, but structural necessity.

**Physical Expression**:
- Spiral phyllotaxis (leaf arrangement)
- Helical growth patterns
- Branch angles relative to trunk

**Testable Prediction**: Pure linear growth should be unstable — all real growth shows curvature or rotation.

---

### Axiom 4: Orthogonal Propagation

> New growth can only emerge perpendicular to the plane of already-resolved recursion. This means branching occurs orthogonal to previous structural axes, as a rotation from past recursion locks.

**Physical Expression**:
- Branches emerge perpendicular to radial wood grain
- Leaves orient perpendicular to stem axis
- Root hairs perpendicular to root surface

**Testable Prediction**: Branch emergence angles cluster around 90° from existing structural axes.

---

### Axiom 5: Energy-Directed Orientation

> Where multiple directions of potential recursion exist, orientation is determined structurally by the gradient of external energy availability. Sunlight, water, and chemical gradients do not "guide" growth—they shape the recursive field such that new Gₙ surfaces emerge preferentially toward them.

**Physical Expression**:
- Phototropism (growth toward light)
- Gravitropism (root/shoot response to gravity)
- Hydrotropism (growth toward water)

**Key Distinction**: Energy gradients don't CAUSE growth direction — they ALTER THE FIELD such that Gₙ surfaces form preferentially in certain orientations.

---

### Axiom 6: Inward Mass Accumulation

> Material density (e.g., wood, fiber) increases only when Gₙ recursion folds inward, adding reinforcement to existing recursion locks. There is no growth at depth—only compression of previous recursion.

**Physical Expression**:
- Annual rings as compressed previous growth
- Heartwood as "locked" early growth
- Bark as accumulated outer boundary layers

**Testable Prediction**: Wood density should increase toward center as compression accumulates.

---

### Axiom 7: Reactivation of Locked Regions

> Regions outside current Gₙ surfaces are in recursion lock and cannot self-update. However, under structural paradox (e.g., increased water tension, damage, environmental shift), a new local Gₙ surface can reactivate recursion, even in previously locked regions.

**Physical Expression**:
- Epicormic buds (dormant buds on trunk activating after damage)
- Wound response (callus formation)
- Dormancy breaking in spring

**Testable Prediction**: Damage or environmental stress should trigger new Gₙ surface formation in previously inactive tissue.

---

### Axiom 8: Gravitational Frame

> In a gravity field, mass gradients are directionally biased. This means the base recursion frame (G₀) always orients away from the gravitational center, defining up/down polarity in root vs shoot systems.

**Physical Expression**:
- Shoot grows opposite to gravity (negative gravitropism)
- Root grows toward gravity (positive gravitropism)
- Polarity maintained even when plant is rotated

**Testable Prediction**: Plants in zero-g should show disrupted polarity or random orientation of root/shoot development.

---

### Axiom 9: Dual Vector Growth

> Every recursion update splits structurally into two vectors:
> - One folds inward (accumulating, densifying)
> - One extends outward (exploring, branching)
>
> These vectors remain balanced across all scales unless distorted by gradient imbalance (e.g., drought, injury, tilt).

**Physical Expression**:
- Simultaneous wood thickening and branch extension
- Root depth vs. root spread balance
- Canopy density vs. canopy extent

**Testable Prediction**: Stress should shift balance toward one vector — drought toward roots/density, abundant resources toward shoots/extension.

---

### Axiom 10: Branches as New Frames

> Branches are not offshoots of existing structures. They are rotated recursion fields, originating from paradox at Gₙ, forming a structurally coherent new Gₙ₊₁ surface.

**Physical Expression**:
- Branch vascular tissue is initially independent
- Branch orientation follows own gravity/light response
- Branch can survive separation (cutting propagation)

**Key Insight**: A branch is a NEW recursive system, not an extension of the old one. It shares resources through the shared Gₙ boundary but has its own paradox center.

## Connection to Cambium Document

The cambium insight (translations/meta/cambium-identity.md) describes the INTERFACE where these axioms operate:

> "The cambium is not a thing—it is the name for the zero-thickness boundary where wood-becoming and bark-becoming have not yet distinguished themselves."

This is the Gₙ surface of plant growth — paradox preserved, enabling both wood (inward accumulation) and bark (outward boundary).

---

## Experimental Predictions

### Prediction 1: Growth Zone Localization
All measurable growth occurs within Gₙ surfaces (meristems, cambium). Tissue outside these surfaces should show zero cell division.

### Prediction 2: Branch Angle Distribution
Branch emergence angles should cluster around values that maximize distance from existing structural axes (≈90° in idealized cases, modified by environmental gradients).

### Prediction 3: Stress-Vector Shift
Resource limitation should shift growth balance:
- Drought → more root mass, less shoot extension
- Shade → more shoot extension, less root mass
- Damage → reactivation of dormant Gₙ surfaces

### Prediction 4: Spiral Constants
Phyllotaxis ratios should approach irrational numbers (especially golden ratio) as plants optimize leaf arrangement for light capture without self-shadowing.

### Prediction 5: Gravity Independence
In microgravity, plants should show:
- Disrupted root/shoot polarity
- Increased spiral/helical growth patterns
- Random branching orientation without environmental gradient cues
