# Framework

*The formal structure behind the translations*

---

## Core Model

### [Recursive Structural Model](../translations/meta/recursive_structural_model.md)
The central claim: stable structures persist by circulating around hollow centers, not by standing on foundations. O → G → P → O recursion cycle.

### [Geometry: The Paradox Sphere (Π₀)](./geometry.md)
How rotating the hyperbola xy=1 through all axes generates a dimensionless sphere around an unreachable center. The minimal geometric structure surviving infinite divisibility.

### [Falsification Criteria](./falsification.md)
What would disprove RSM. A framework that cannot be wrong cannot be right. Specific predictions that can be empirically tested.

## Physics Synthesis

**The central thesis: Energy is rotation.**

The RSM framework reinterprets fundamental physics through a single lens: reality cannot occupy its own center, so it turns. These five synthesis documents demonstrate the consequences:

### [Physics Hub — Entry Point](./physics_synthesis_hub.md)
Navigation document explaining how all physics reduces to one question: What is Zₙ (rotation) doing?

| Document | Core Finding |
|----------|--------------|
| [1. Energy Conservation](./energy_conservation_synthesis.md) | Energy is the structural turning required to preserve paradox |
| [2. Time as Recursion](./time_recursion_synthesis.md) | Time is what successful rotation feels like from inside |
| [3. Black Holes](./black_hole_synthesis.md) | Black holes are what happens when rotation fails |
| [4. Quantum Measurement](./quantum_measurement_synthesis.md) | Quantum states are rotation before angle selection |
| [5. Mathematical Formalism](./formalism_synthesis.md) | The Lagrangian IS Wu Wei in mathematical form |

**Key insight:** These are not separate phenomena requiring separate explanations. They are structural consequences of the same geometric necessity.

## Cross-Domain Validation

### [Academic Parallels (18 Frameworks)](./academic_parallels.md)
Wheeler, Bohm, Rovelli, Hofstadter, Kauffman, Varela, and 12 more. Where established frameworks converge on similar structures.

### [Plant Axioms (Biology)](./plant_axioms.md)
10 testable predictions about where growth occurs: meristems and cambium as G surfaces where recursion updates.

- [Scythe Not Knife](../translations/meta/scythe_not_knife_2025-11-27.md) — Key etymological discovery: 利 = arc operation
- [Forge Transformation Grammar](../translations/meta/forge_transformation_grammar_2025-12-07.md)
- [Radical Families](../translations/meta/radical_families_grain_blade_2025-12-07.md)

## Governance

How the text encodes governance as channeling, not ruling:

- [Hydraulic Origin of Governance](../translations/meta/hydraulic_origin_of_governance_2025-11-27.md)

## Key Documents

- [Chapter 25 — Rosetta Stone](../translations/meta/chapter25_rosetta_stone_2025-12-07.md) — The decoder key
- [Synthesis](../translations/meta/framework_synthesis_2025-12-07.md) — Cross-domain integration

## Reading Order

**For the skeptic:** Start with [Falsification Criteria](./falsification.md), then [Academic Parallels](./academic_parallels.md).

**For the physicist:** Start with [Physics Hub](./physics_synthesis_hub.md), then work through the five synthesis documents.

**For the biologist:** Start with [Plant Axioms](./plant_axioms.md).

**For the sinologist:** Start with [Radical Technology Encoding](../translations/meta/radical_technology_encoding_2025-11-27.md), then [Scythe Not Knife](../translations/meta/scythe_not_knife_2025-11-27.md).

**For everyone:** See [Reading Paths](../reading_paths.md) for guided routes.
