*The pattern in living systems.*

## Core Document

- **[Plant Axioms](../../framework/plant_axioms.md)**

*More biology documents are in development. The framework predicts specific patterns in biological systems — cell division as recursive bifurcation, metabolism as rotation, morphogenesis as structural emergence.*
