*The shape of the pattern. Paradox resolved in structure.*

## Core Document

- **[The Paradox Sphere](../framework/geometry.md)**
  How apparent paradoxes (being/non-being, one/many, same/different) resolve as positions on a unified geometric structure.

## The Shape

The pattern described in the Dao De Jing has specific geometric properties:

1. **Self-similarity** — The same structure at all scales
2. **Recursion** — Returns to origin while expanding outward
3. **Complementarity** — Opposites as positions, not contradictions
4. **Continuity** — No edges, no boundaries, no outside

Chapter 25 states this explicitly:

> 大曰逝，逝曰遠，遠曰反
> Great means departing, departing means far, far means returning

This describes a sphere — the only shape where maximum extension equals return to origin.
