# Physics

*Energy is rotation. The pattern appears in physics.*

---

## The Hub

- **[Energy Is Rotation](../../framework/physics_synthesis_hub.md)**
  The central thesis: all forms of energy are rotational patterns at different scales.

---

## Domains

- **[Energy Conservation](../../framework/energy_conservation_synthesis.md)**
  Why energy cannot be created or destroyed — the topological necessity.

- **[Time as Recursion](../../framework/time_recursion_synthesis.md)**
  Time isn't a river. It's the counting of recursive cycles.

- **[Black Holes](../../framework/black_hole_synthesis.md)**
  Where rotation fails. The boundary condition.

- **[Quantum Measurement](../../framework/quantum_measurement_synthesis.md)**
  Observation as frame selection. Why measurement "collapses" superposition.

---

## Formalism

- **[Mathematical Formalism](../../framework/formalism_synthesis.md)**
  The equations. How this maps to physics notation.
