# The Pattern

*Physics, geometry, mathematics*

---

You came through the door marked "Pattern." Good.

Here's what you'll find: the same structure showing up across domains that shouldn't share structure. Physics. Biology. Ancient Chinese. Mathematics. The question isn't whether the pattern exists—it keeps appearing whether we look for it or not. The question is what it means.

## Start Here

**[Recursive Structural Model](../translations/meta/recursive_structural_model.md)** — The formal framework. Origin → Gradient → Periphery → Recursion. How stable structures persist without foundations.

**[Physics Synthesis Hub](../framework/physics_synthesis_hub.md)** — "Energy is rotation." Five physics domains reread through the lens of circulation around hollow centers.

## The Framework

The core geometry: why rotation around paradox generates stable structure.

- [Geometry — The Paradox Sphere](../framework/geometry.md)
- [Falsification Criteria](../framework/falsification.md) — What would disprove this
- [Academic Parallels](../framework/academic_parallels.md) — 18 existing frameworks that converge

## Physics Synthesis

Five domains. Same pattern.

| Domain | Document | Core Insight |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Energy | [Energy Conservation](../framework/energy_conservation_synthesis.md) | Energy as structural turning to preserve paradox |
| Time | [Time as Recursion](../framework/time_recursion_synthesis.md) | Time as what successful rotation feels like inside |
| Gravity | [Black Holes](../framework/black_hole_synthesis.md) | Black holes as rotation failure points |
| Quantum | [Quantum Measurement](../framework/quantum_measurement_synthesis.md) | Quantum states as pre-angle-selection rotation |
| Math | [Mathematical Formalism](../framework/formalism_synthesis.md) | Lagrangian as the math of Wu Wei |

## Biology

Life as pattern-following.

- [Plant Axioms](../framework/plant_axioms.md) — How trees encode the geometry

## Synthesis Documents

Where the threads meet.

- [Framework Synthesis](../translations/meta/framework_synthesis_2025-12-07.md) — Full integration
- [Chapter 25 as Rosetta Stone](../translations/meta/chapter25_rosetta_stone_2025-12-07.md) — One chapter decoding all domains
- [可/常 Scale Recursion](../translations/meta/ke_chang_scale_recursion_2025-12-11.md) — Every expressible is an invariant at its own level
