# The Weave

*Wander between branches. Watch them rhyme.*

---

This isn't a single path. It's a network.

Each branch — Living, Physics, Text, Geometry, Human, Lore — shows the same pattern from a different angle. Follow any one far enough and you find the others.

## Cross-References

Places where branches touch:

### Physics ↔ Text
- [Chapter 11 — Void and Function](../translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md) describes the wheel. [Energy Is Rotation](../framework/physics_synthesis_hub.md) describes why.

### Living ↔ Geometry
- Tree rings demonstrate the paradox sphere. Growth radiates from a center that stays hollow.

### Human ↔ Physics
- [Quantum Measurement](../framework/quantum_measurement_synthesis.md) — the observer is part of the circulation, not outside it.

### Text ↔ Geometry
- [Chapter 25](../translations/chapters/chapter25_sphere_proof_2025-12-01.md) describes 大→逝→遠→反. Euler's identity shows why.

### Lore ↔ Living
- The ouroboros and the tree ring are the same pattern seen from different angles.

## The Principle

You don't have to follow any path. You can jump. The structure is the same everywhere.

*Enter anywhere. The center is everywhere.*
