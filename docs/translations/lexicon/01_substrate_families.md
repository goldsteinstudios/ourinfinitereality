# Part I: Substrate Families

*What gets acted upon*

---

## The Principle

Substrate radicals encode **what domain receives the operation**. The grain field, the water, the heart, the value—these are the materials that operators transform. Understanding the substrate tells you what KIND of transformation is happening.

### Radical Breakdown Convention

Throughout this lexicon, radicals are decomposed to their pictographic origins:

```
Character (pinyin) = Component₁ (pinyin) + Component₂ (pinyin)
                   = pictographic meaning + pictographic meaning
                   = combined structural meaning
```

Example:
```
治 (zhì) = 氵 (shuǐ) + 台 (tái)
         = water + platform

台 (tái) = 厶 (sī) + 口 (kǒu)
         = coiled/contained + opening
         = stable-above + passage-below
         = aqueduct cross-section

∴ 治 = water flowing through aqueduct = governance through aligned infrastructure
```

---

## 禾 (hé) — The Grain Substrate

**Pictographic origin:** 禾 depicts a grain plant with drooping head—millet or rice ready for harvest.

**Domain:** Discrete, countable, harvestable resources. Standing field. Distributed potential.

**Geometric Principle:** The undifferentiated field awaiting arc-operation. Infinite stalks, each distinct, yet forming unified expanse. What exists before the scythe sweeps.

**Key insight:** 禾 (hé) represents what CAN be harvested but hasn't been yet. It's potential held in distributed form.

### Characters Built on 禾

| Character | Pinyin | + Operator | Transformation | DDJ Chapters | Guodian? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **利** | lì | 刂 (blade) | Scythe arcs through → harvest/path-cutting | 8, 11, 22, 56, 81 | ✓ A01 |
| **和** | hé | 口 (mouth) | Grain distributed → harmonious flow | 2, 4, 42, 55, 56 | ✓ A15, A28 |
| **積** | jī | 責 (burden) | Grain + obligation → accumulated store | 9, 81 | ✓ |
| **私** | sī | 厶 (private) | Grain privatized → personal portion | 7 | — |
| **穀** | gǔ | 殳+禾 | Striker + grain → valley/worthiness | 39, 42 | ✓ |
| **稀** | xī | 希 (rare) | Grain rare → sparse/scattered | 41 | — |
| **秀** | xiù | 乃 (emerging) | Grain emerging → flowering/excellence | — | — |
| **秋** | qiū | 火 (fire) | Grain + fire → autumn (harvest season) | — | — |
| **委** | wěi | 女 (woman) | Grain + woman → entrust/delegate | — | — |
| **香** | xiāng | 日 (sun) | Grain + sun → fragrance | — | — |

### Full Radical Breakdowns

**利 (lì) — Scythe harvest:**
```
利 (lì) = 禾 (hé) + 刂 (dāo)
        = grain + blade

刂/刀 (dāo) = pictograph of blade with handle
            = curved stroke (blade) + vertical with hook (two-handed grip)
            = complete scythe geometry: blade ⊥ handle

∴ 利 = scythe arcing through grain field = π-operation = harvest-capacity
```

**和 (hé) — Harmonious distribution:**
```
和 (hé) = 禾 (hé) + 口 (kǒu)
        = grain + mouth/opening

口 (kǒu) = pictograph of open mouth

∴ 和 = grain distributed through openings = harmony through sharing
```

**積 (jī) — Accumulated store:**
```
積 (jī) = 禾 (hé) + 責 (zé)
        = grain + burden/obligation

責 (zé) = 朿 (cì, thorns) + 貝 (bèi, value)
        = thorns + shell/value
        = obligation that pricks

∴ 積 = grain under obligation = accumulated burden = what 聖人不積 warns against
```

### Pattern Analysis

**When 禾 (hé) receives cutting operator 刂 (dāo):**
- 利 (lì): The scythe sweeps, the grain falls, paths are cut through the field
- This is the π-operation—productive transformation through arc

**When 禾 (hé) receives distribution operator 口 (kǒu):**
- 和 (hé): Grain flows through mouths, harmony emerges from distribution
- This is sharing—not cutting but allocating

**When 禾 (hé) receives burden/obligation 責 (zé):**
- 積 (jī): Grain becomes accumulated store, burden of holdings
- This is 不積 (bù jī, non-accumulation) principle's target

**When 禾 (hé) receives privacy 厶 (sī):**
- 私 (sī): Grain becomes personal portion, separated from common
- This is what Chapter 7 warns against (self-interested hoarding)

**Structural insight:** 禾 (hé) substrate characters cluster around harvest, distribution, and accumulation—the fundamental economic operations. The text's position: 利 (lì, arc-harvest) good; 積 (jī, accumulation) problematic; 和 (hé, distribution) optimal.

## 氵 (shuǐ) — The Water Substrate

**Pictographic origin:** 氵 is the three-stroke form of 水 (shuǐ), depicting flowing water—the middle stroke is the main current, outer strokes are splashing/eddies.

**Domain:** Continuous, flowing, transforming medium. What seeks lowest path naturally.

**Geometric Principle:** Does the π-operation without effort. Water IS 無為 (wú wéi) made physical—it arcs around obstacles, finds paths, transforms without forcing.

**Key insight:** 氵 (shuǐ) represents continuous potential in motion. Unlike 禾 (hé, discrete, standing), water is already flowing, already finding path.

### Characters Built on 氵

| Character | Pinyin | + Operator | Transformation | DDJ Chapters | Guodian? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **淵** | yuān | (deep) | Water deepened → profound source/abyss | 4, 8 | ✓ A23 |
| **沖** | chōng | 中 (center) | Water centered → hollow/concentrated | 4, 42 | ✓ A23 |
| **清** | qīng | 青 (clear) | Water clarified → transparency | 15, 45 | ✓ A09 |
| **深** | shēn | (probe) | Water probed → depth | 4, 15 | — |
| **渾** | hún | 昆 (mingle) | Water mingled → murky/primordial | 15, 25 | ✓ A08 |
| **治** | zhì | 台 (platform) | Water channeled → governance | 3, 17, 60, 64 | ✓ |
| **泮** | pàn | 半 (half) | Water halving → dissolve/melt | 64 | ✓ A25 |
| **法** | fǎ | 去 (remove) | Water removes → law/method | 25 | ✓ A23 |
| **海** | hǎi | 每 (every) | Water everywhere → ocean | throughout | ✓ |
| **江** | jiāng | 工 (work) | Water working → great river | throughout | ✓ |
| **池** | chí | 也 (also) | Water also → pool | — | — |
| **流** | liú | 㐬 (flow) | Water flowing → stream/current | — | — |
| **滿** | mǎn | 㒼 (full) | Water filled → full/complete | — | — |
| **漸** | jiàn | 斬 (cut) | Water cutting → gradual | — | — |
| **溪** | xī | 奚 (servant) | Water serving → mountain stream | — | — |

### Full Radical Breakdowns

**治 (zhì) — Governance through infrastructure:**
```
治 (zhì) = 氵 (shuǐ) + 台 (tái)
         = water + platform

台 (tái) = 厶 (sī) + 口 (kǒu)
         = coiled/contained + opening

厶 (sī) = pictograph of coiled/private form (silkworm? enclosure?)
口 (kǒu) = pictograph of open mouth

台 = stable-top (厶) over passage-below (口) = aqueduct cross-section

∴ 治 = water flowing through aqueduct = governance as aligned infrastructure
      = build correctly, let gravity work
```

**淵 (yuān) — Generative abyss:**
```
淵 (yuān) = 氵 (shuǐ) + 囦 (yuān, archaic "abyss")
          = water + deep enclosure

∴ 淵 = water in deep enclosure = the source-depth (Ch.4: 淵兮似萬物之宗)
```

**沖 (chōng) — Hollow center:**
```
沖 (chōng) = 氵 (shuǐ) + 中 (zhōng)
           = water + center

中 (zhōng) = pictograph of arrow through center of target

∴ 沖 = water at center = hollow, concentrated flow = 道沖 (dào chōng, pattern is hollow)
```

### Pattern Analysis

**When 氵 (shuǐ) receives depth operators:**
- 淵 (yuān): Deep water → the generative abyss (Chapter 4: 淵兮似萬物之宗, yuān xī sì wàn wù zhī zōng)
- 深 (shēn): Probed water → depth itself
- These are source-characters, pointing to the generative void

**When 氵 (shuǐ) receives centering operator 中 (zhōng):**
- 沖 (chōng): Water at center → hollow, concentrated flow
- This IS Chapter 4's 道沖 (dào chōng, pattern is hollow)

**When 氵 (shuǐ) receives clarity operators:**
- 清 (qīng): Clarified → transparent, settled
- 渾 (hún): Mingled → murky, undifferentiated
- These are observation-state characters (Chapter 15: 孰能濁以靜之徐清, shú néng zhuó yǐ jìng zhī xú qīng)

**When 氵 (shuǐ) receives channeling operator 台 (tái):**
- 治 (zhì): Water channeled → governance
- This is 無為 (wú wéi) governance—water organizes by finding level, not by forcing

**Structural insight:** 氵 (shuǐ) characters form a complete vocabulary for the Dao De Jing's (道德經, dào dé jīng) teaching on flow, depth, clarity, and self-organization. Water doesn't appear as metaphor—water IS the demonstration.

---

## 心 (xīn) — The Heart/Mind Substrate

**Pictographic origin:** 心 depicts the heart organ with chambers/vessels—the physical heart understood as seat of mind and intention.

**Domain:** Internal states, cognitive dynamics, emotional orientation, intentionality.

**Geometric Principle:** What happens inside the observer. The internal field where alignment 德 (dé) or misalignment occurs.

**Key insight:** 心 (xīn) substrate determines quality of engagement with pattern. The heart can align 德 (dé), can constant 恆/常 (héng/cháng), can expand 慈 (cí), or can harden.

### Characters Built on 心

| Character | Pinyin | + Operator | Transformation | DDJ Chapters | Guodian? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **德** | dé | 彳+直 (step+straight) | Heart stepping straight → alignment | 38, 51, etc. | ✓ throughout |
| **恆** | héng | 亘 (span) | Heart spanning → constant | throughout | ✓ |
| **慈** | cí | 茲 (multiply) | Heart multiplied → expansive care | 67 | ✓ |
| **愈** | yù | 俞 (more) | Heart increasing → even more | 81 | ✓ |
| **慎** | shèn | 真 (true) | Heart true → careful/cautious | 64 | ✓ B06 |
| **悶** | mèn | 門 (gate) | Heart gated → depressed/dull | 58 | — |
| **忘** | wàng | 亡 (disappear) | Heart disappeared → forget | — | — |
| **念** | niàn | 今 (present) | Heart present → thought/mindful | — | — |
| **恥** | chǐ | 耳 (ear) | Heart + ear → shame | — | — |
| **悅** | yuè | 兌 (exchange) | Heart exchanged → pleased | — | — |
| **情** | qíng | 青 (clear) | Heart clarified → emotion/situation | — | — |
| **惟** | wéi | 隹 (bird) | Heart + bird → only/consider | 21 | ✓ |

### Full Radical Breakdowns

**德 (dé) — Alignment with pattern:**
```
德 (dé) = 彳 (chì) + 直 (zhí) + 心 (xīn)
        = stepping + straight + heart

彳 (chì) = pictograph of left step/walking
直 (zhí) = 十 (shí, ten) + 目 (mù, eye) + 乚 (hook)
         = eye looking straight ahead
心 (xīn) = pictograph of heart

∴ 德 = heart stepping straight = alignment with pattern = NOT "virtue"
```

**恆 (héng) — Frame-independent constancy:**
```
恆 (héng) = 忄 (xīn variant) + 亘 (gèn)
          = heart + spanning/stretching across

亘 (gèn) = 二 (èr, two) + 日 (rì, sun)
         = sun spanning between two bounds = stretching across time

∴ 恆 = heart spanning frames = constant across contexts = 常 (cháng)
```

**慈 (cí) — Expansive care:**
```
慈 (cí) = 茲 (zī) + 心 (xīn)
        = multiplying + heart

茲 (zī) = 艹 (cǎo, grass) + 幺幺 (yāo yāo, double threads)
        = grass multiplying = proliferation

∴ 慈 = heart multiplied = expansive care (one of Three Treasures, Ch.67)
```

### Pattern Analysis

**When 心 (xīn) receives stepping operator 彳+直 (chì + zhí):**
- 德 (dé): Heart steps straight → alignment with pattern
- This is the key character: 德 (dé) isn't virtue but structural alignment

**When 心 (xīn) receives spanning operator 亘 (gèn):**
- 恆/常 (héng/cháng): Heart spans frames → frame-independent constancy
- This is the 常 (cháng) that can't be named (常道 cháng dào, 常名 cháng míng)

**When 心 (xīn) receives multiplication 茲 (zī):**
- 慈 (cí): Heart multiplied → expansive care (not sentimental but structural)
- One of the Three Treasures (Chapter 67)

**When 心 (xīn) receives truth operator 真 (zhēn):**
- 慎 (shèn): Heart held true → careful, cautious
- Chapter 64: 慎終若始 (shèn zhōng ruò shǐ, careful-end as careful-beginning)

**Structural insight:** 心 (xīn) characters encode the OBSERVER'S state. Whether the heart is aligned 德 (dé), constant 恆 (héng), careful 慎 (shèn), or blocked 悶 (mèn) determines how pattern is perceived and engaged. The text isn't about feelings—it's about observer-configuration.

## 貝 (bèi) — The Value/Exchange Substrate

**Pictographic origin:** 貝 depicts a cowrie shell—the original currency in ancient China. The shell's form is still visible: two halves with ridged interior.

**Domain:** Worth, exchange, trade, what can be measured against other things.

**Geometric Principle:** What has agreed equivalence. The shell (original currency) marks stable exchange value.

**Key insight:** 貝 (bèi) substrate is about commensurability—what can be weighed, traded, compared. When operators act on value, they produce social/economic structures.

### Characters Built on 貝

| Character | Pinyin | + Operator | Transformation | DDJ Chapters | Guodian? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **則** | zé | 刂 (blade) | Value cut → consequent pattern/rule | 3, 22, 64 | ✓ |
| **貴** | guì | 臾 (high) | Value elevated → precious/honored | 13, 56, 72, 81 | ✓ |
| **賤** | jiàn | 戔 (small) | Value diminished → cheap/lowly | 39, 56 | ✓ |
| **財** | cái | 才 (talent) | Value talented → wealth/resources | — | — |
| **貨** | huò | 化 (change) | Value changed → goods/merchandise | 3, 12, 53, 64 | ✓ |
| **賊** | zéi | 戎 (weapons) | Value weaponized → thief/traitor | 19 | ✓ A01 |
| **責** | zé | 朿 (thorn) | Value thorned → obligation/burden | (in 積) | — |
| **賓** | bīn | 宀 (roof) | Value housed → guest | — | — |
| **費** | fèi | 弗 (not) | Value negated → expense/waste | — | — |
| **資** | zī | 次 (order) | Value ordered → resources | — | — |

### Full Radical Breakdowns

**則 (zé) — Consequent pattern:**
```
則 (zé) = 貝 (bèi) + 刂 (dāo)
        = shell/value + blade

刂 (dāo) = pictograph of blade

∴ 則 = blade cuts through value = consequent pattern emerges = rule/law
     = how social rules emerge: value-distinctions cut into pattern
```

### Pattern Analysis

**When 貝 (bèi) receives cutting operator 刂 (dāo):**
- 則 (zé): Value cut → consequent pattern, rule established
- This is how social rules emerge: value-distinctions cut into pattern

**When 貝 (bèi) receives elevation/diminishment:**
- 貴 (guì): Value elevated → precious (what's highly valued)
- 賤 (jiàn): Value diminished → cheap (what's lowly valued)
- Chapter 56: 不可得而貴，不可得而賤 (bù kě dé ér guì, bù kě dé ér jiàn — cannot be made precious or cheap)

**When 貝 (bèi) receives transformation 化 (huà):**
- 貨 (huò): Value transformed → goods, merchandise
- Chapter 12: 難得之貨 (nán dé zhī huò, hard-to-get goods) cause people to harm themselves

**When 貝 (bèi) receives weapons 戎 (róng):**
- 賊 (zéi): Value weaponized → thief
- Chapter 19: 盜賊無有 (dào zéi wú yǒu, robbers and thieves will not exist)

**Structural insight:** 貝 (bèi) characters encode the VALUE SYSTEM—what society prizes, trades, hoards. The text's position: 貴 (guì) and 賤 (jiàn) are frame-dependent (玄同 xuán tóng is beyond them); 貨 (huò, goods-accumulation) distorts; 賊 (zéi, value-theft) follows from scarcity-creation.

---

## 木 (mù) — The Wood/Tree Substrate

**Pictographic origin:** 木 depicts a tree with trunk (vertical), branches (upper strokes), and roots (lower strokes). The complete organic structure in one character.

**Domain:** Organic structure, growth patterns, material that was once alive.

**Geometric Principle:** Demonstrates growth rings—the cambium principle. Living structure that records time through continuous boundary operation.

**Key insight:** 木 (mù) represents organic pattern—what grows, what has structure, what demonstrates living geometry.

### Characters Built on 木

| Character | Pinyin | + Operator | Transformation | DDJ Chapters | Guodian? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **本** | běn | — (root) | Wood rooted → root/origin | 26, 39 | ✓ |
| **末** | mò | — (tip) | Wood tipped → tip/end | 38, 64 | ✓ B01 |
| **朴** | pǔ | 卜 (divine) | Wood uncarved → simplicity/uncarved block | 15, 19, 28, 32, 37, 57 | ✓ |
| **根** | gēn | 艮 (limit) | Wood limited → root | 16, 26, 59 | ✓ A24 |
| **果** | guǒ | 田 (field) | Wood fielded → fruit/result | 30, 73 | ✓ A06 |
| **材** | cái | — (substance) | Wood substanced → material/timber | 28 | — |
| **相** | xiāng | 目 (eye) | Wood eyed → mutual/each other | 2, etc. | ✓ A15 |
| **林** | lín | 木+木 | Wood doubled → forest | — | — |
| **枝** | zhī | 支 (branch) | Wood branched → limb | — | — |
| **樸** | pǔ | 菐 (humble) | Wood humbled → uncarved simplicity | (variant of 朴) | ✓ |

### Full Radical Breakdowns

**本 (běn) — Root/Origin:**
```
本 (běn) = 木 (mù) + 一 (yī, one stroke at base)
         = tree + mark at root

∴ 本 = the root of the tree = origin, source, foundation
```

**末 (mò) — Tip/End:**
```
末 (mò) = 木 (mù) + 一 (yī, one stroke at top)
         = tree + mark at tip

∴ 末 = the tip of the tree = end, surface, periphery
```

**朴/樸 (pǔ) — Uncarved block:**
```
朴 (pǔ) = 木 (mù) + 卜 (bǔ)
        = wood + divination/simple

卜 (bǔ) = pictograph of crack pattern in oracle bone divination

∴ 朴 = wood in natural state = uncarved block = simplicity before distinction
     = 道 (dào) before it's cut into 名 (míng)
```

### Pattern Analysis

**When 木 (mù) receives root/tip marking:**
- 本 (běn): Root → origin, source, what grounds
- 末 (mò): Tip → end, surface, what extends
- Chapter 38: substance/display, root/flower

**When 木 (mù) receives uncarved state 卜 (bǔ):**
- 朴/樸 (pǔ): Uncarved block → simplicity before distinction
- This is 道 (dào) before it's cut into 名 (míng)—potential before articulation

**When 木 (mù) receives limit operator 艮 (gèn):**
- 根 (gēn): Root → what anchors, what grounds
- Chapter 16: 歸根曰靜 (guī gēn yuē jìng, returning to root is called stillness)

**When 木 (mù) receives eye operator 目 (mù):**
- 相 (xiāng): Wood + eye → mutual seeing/each other
- The 相X (xiāng) operations (相生 xiāng shēng, 相成 xiāng chéng, etc.) build on this root

**Structural insight:** 木 (mù) characters encode ORGANIC STRUCTURE—roots, tips, growth, simplicity. The 朴 (pǔ, uncarved block) is particularly important: it's pattern before cutting, potential before articulation. The text keeps returning to 朴 (pǔ) as the state before distinctions divide.

---

## 土 (tǔ) — The Earth/Ground Substrate

**Pictographic origin:** 土 depicts a mound of earth or altar—the horizontal stroke is ground level, the vertical stroke represents earth rising up, the lower stroke is the base/foundation.

**Domain:** Ground, soil, territory, what provides foundation.

**Geometric Principle:** The substrate beneath substrates. What everything else stands on.

**Key insight:** 土 (tǔ) represents grounding, foundation, place. Not flowing like water 水 (shuǐ), not standing like grain 禾 (hé), but the base that holds.

### Characters Built on 土

| Character | Pinyin | + Operator | Transformation | DDJ Chapters | Guodian? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **地** | dì | 也 (also) | Earth extended → ground/territory | 1, 7, 25, 39 | ✓ A21, A38 |
| **堅** | jiān | 臤 (firm) | Earth firmed → solid/hard | 76, 78 | ✓ |
| **塞** | sāi | 宀+土 | Earth under roof → block/seal | 52, 56 | ✓ A27, B05 |
| **城** | chéng | 成 (complete) | Earth completed → city wall | — | — |
| **埏** | shān | 延 (extend) | Earth extended → mold (pottery) | 11 | ✓ A07 |
| **均** | jūn | 匀 (even) | Earth evened → equal/uniform | 57 | ✓ A30 |
| **坤** | kūn | 申 (extend) | Earth extending → receptive (I Ching) | — | — |
| **堂** | táng | 尚 (esteem) | Earth esteemed → hall | — | — |
| **墓** | mù | 莫 (none) | Earth silenced → grave | — | — |

### Full Radical Breakdowns

**地 (dì) — Ground/Territory:**
```
地 (dì) = 土 (tǔ) + 也 (yě)
        = earth + also/extending

也 (yě) = pictograph possibly of a serpent or extending form

∴ 地 = earth extending = ground, territory
```

**堅 (jiān) — Solid/Hard:**
```
堅 (jiān) = 臤 (qiān) + 土 (tǔ)
          = firm/stern + earth

臤 (qiān) = 臣 (chén, minister) + 又 (yòu, hand)
          = minister controlled by hand = firmness

∴ 堅 = firmed earth = solid, hard = what Chapter 76 warns against
```

### Pattern Analysis

**When 土 (tǔ) receives extension 也 (yě), 延 (yán):**
- 地 (dì): Earth extended → ground, territory
- 埏 (shān): Earth extended → molding (Chapter 11's potter)

**When 土 (tǔ) receives firmness 臤 (qiān):**
- 堅 (jiān): Earth firmed → solid, hard
- Chapter 76: 堅強者死之徒 (jiān qiáng zhě sǐ zhī tú, the hard and stiff are death's followers)

**When 土 (tǔ) receives covering/sealing:**
- 塞 (sāi): Earth sealed → blocked
- Chapter 56: 塞其兌，閉其門 (sāi qí duì, bì qí mén — block openings, close gates)

**When 土 (tǔ) receives evening 匀 (yún):**
- 均 (jūn): Earth evened → equal, uniform
- Chapter 57: 民自均 (mín zì jūn, people self-equalize)

**Structural insight:** 土 (tǔ) characters encode FOUNDATION and SOLIDITY. The text's ambivalence: 地 (dì, ground) is necessary foundation; but 堅 (jiān, hardness) leads to death. The earth that yields (allows molding, allows blocking) works; the earth that rigidifies fails.

## Summary: The Substrate Grammar

| Substrate | Pinyin | Domain | What It Awaits | Key Transformation |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 禾 | hé | Discrete resources | Arc-operation | 利 lì (harvest through π-sweep) |
| 氵 | shuǐ | Continuous flow | Self-finds path | 治 zhì (governance through natural channeling) |
| 心 | xīn | Internal state | Alignment | 德 dé (stepping straight with pattern) |
| 貝 | bèi | Exchange worth | Cutting into rules | 則 zé (consequent pattern) |
| 木 | mù | Organic structure | Grounding | 朴 pǔ (uncarved potential) |
| 土 | tǔ | Foundation | Yielding | 均 jūn (self-equalizing) |

### The Prediction Test

If this substrate grammar is real, then:
1. Similar substrates should produce similar character meanings
2. The substrate should predict what KIND of operation makes sense
3. Character combinations should be semantically consistent

**Test: What can 刂 (dāo, blade) usefully operate on?**
- 禾 (hé, grain) → 利 (lì, harvest) ✓ makes sense
- 貝 (bèi, value) → 則 (zé, rule) ✓ makes sense
- 岡 (gāng, ridge) → 剛 (gāng, rigid) ✓ makes sense (failure mode)
- 水 (shuǐ, water) → ? (you can't scythe water—and there's no such character)

**Prediction confirmed.** The blade operates on what can be arc-cut. Water flows around; it can't be scythed. The character system knows this.

**Test: What can 口 (kǒu, opening) usefully distribute?**
- 禾 (hé, grain) → 和 (hé, harmony) ✓ distributed grain
- 夕 (xī, darkness) → 名 (míng, name) ✓ articulated darkness
- 矢 (shǐ, arrow) → 知 (zhī, knowing) ✓ targeted articulation
- 水 (shuǐ, water) → ? (water doesn't need mouth to flow—it finds path naturally)

**Prediction confirmed.** The opening operates on what needs passage-creation. Water is already flowing.

**The substrate grammar is real. The radicals encode domains. The combinations follow rules.**
