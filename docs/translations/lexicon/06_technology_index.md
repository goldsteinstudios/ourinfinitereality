| Knot | 結 | P-position where flow becomes place |

**Entry chapters:** 25 (recursion cycle), 52 (母/子 relationship)

**What the loom teaches:**
- Warp must be established before weft can operate
- Fabric exists only at perpendicular crossing

## Cross-Technology Patterns

### The Same Principle in Different Substrates

| Principle | Weaving | Metal | Water | Wood |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| Perpendicularity | Warp⊥Weft | Edge⊥Force | Flow⊥Bank | Grain⊥Cut |
| Rate matters | Shuttle speed | Quench speed | Flow rate | Drying rate |
| 剛/柔 gradient | Tight/loose weave | Edge/spine | Channel/flood | Heartwood/sap |
| 無為 | Let shuttle pass | Let water quench | Let flow find | Let wood dry |

### Universal Failure Modes

Every technology fails the same two ways:

| Failure | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| Pure 剛 | Brittle blade, rigid teaching, forced growth |
| Pure 柔 | Shapeless clay, formless instruction, unstructured space |

The solution is never "choose one." The solution is always "correct distribution."

---

## Reading Your Tools

Every handmade tool carries documentation on its surface:

| What to Look For | What It Tells You |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Wear patterns | How it was used |
| Repair history | What stressed it |
| Material choice | What was available/valued |
| Proportions | What trade-offs were made |
| Finish quality | How much attention was given |

Mass production broke this. A handmade tool teaches you how to use it. A mass-produced tool requires a manual.

---

## The Navigation Principle

The DDJ is not a book to read linearly. It's an index.

**If you work with X substrate, start with Y chapter.**

The text points to where the knowledge lives—in the technologies themselves. The characters encode what the tools already knew.

Your craft is your entry point. The geometry is the same throughout.
