structural_summary: |
  The chapter establishes the coordinate system for all that follows.
  Two registers (常/可) mark whether distinction has operated.
  Two poles (無/有) mark what distinction produces.
  玄 marks where axes cross — the paradoxical origin preserved.
  The structure is recursive: 玄之又玄 = any point can become new origin.
