# Character Drift: Guodian -> Received Text
# Documents systematic changes between ~300 BCE bamboo slips and later versions

variants:
  # Critical semantic shift - hydraulic to abstract
  潰_逝:
    guodian: 潰
    guodian_pinyin: kuì
    received: 逝
    received_pinyin: shì
    chapters: [25]
    drift: "hydraulic overflow -> abstract departure"
    structural_impact: "high"
    notes: |
      Chapter 25: 大曰潰 (great is called overflow)
      Guodian preserves concrete hydraulic metaphor - water overflowing a vessel
      Received abstracts to "passing away" or "departing"
      The physical image of overflow better matches the recursion pattern:
      大 -> 潰 -> 遠 -> 反 (unbounded -> overflow -> extended -> reversal)

  # Relational absence vs absolute void
  亡_無:
    guodian: 亡
    guodian_pinyin: wáng
    received: 無
    received_pinyin: wú
    chapters: [11, 37, 40, 48]
    drift: "relational absence -> absolute void"
    structural_impact: "medium"
    notes: |
      亡 means "lost" or "absent" - implies something was there
      無 suggests more absolute non-existence
      Guodian's 亡 preserves relational quality - absence relative to presence
      This matches 有無相生 (presence/absence co-arise) better

  # Han dynasty taboo substitution
  恆_常:
    guodian: 恆
    guodian_pinyin: héng
    received: 常
    received_pinyin: cháng
    chapters: [1, 16, 32, 37, 46, 52]
    drift: "active persistence -> static implicitness"
    structural_impact: "medium"
    cause: "Han dynasty taboo avoidance (Emperor Wen's name)"
    notes: |
      恆 (忄+ 亙) = heart + span = actively persisting across
      常 (尚 + 巾) = elevated + cloth = fixed/constant
      The Guodian version suggests dynamic maintenance
      The received version suggests static unchangingness
      Both point to frame-independence, but different emphasis

  # Structural impossibility vs simple negation
  弗_不:
    guodian: 弗
    guodian_pinyin: fú
    received: 不
    received_pinyin: bù
    chapters: [2, 30, 37, 51, 64]
    drift: "structural impossibility -> simple negation"
    structural_impact: "low-medium"
    notes: |
      弗 implies cannot/does-not by nature (structural)
      不 is simple negation (situational)
      Example: 生而弗有 = "generates yet structurally cannot possess"
      vs 生而不有 = "generates yet doesn't possess"
      The Guodian emphasizes inherent impossibility

  # Conditional appearance vs static resemblance
  若_如:
    guodian: 若
    guodian_pinyin: ruò
    received: 如
    received_pinyin: rú
    chapters: [15, 41, 64]
    drift: "conditional appearance -> static resemblance"
    structural_impact: "high"
    notes: |
      若 = "appears as if" (conditional, frame-dependent)
      如 = "is like" (static comparison)
      Critical for Chapter 41: 若 operator
      上德若谷 = "optimal alignment appears as valley" (from misaligned frame)
      The 若 operator documents how pattern appears paradoxical
      from frame-dependent positions

  # Emphatic particles lost
  也_removed:
    guodian: 也
    guodian_pinyin: yě
    received: "(removed)"
    chapters: [40]
    drift: "emphatic markers removed"
    structural_impact: "low"
    notes: |
      Chapter 40 Guodian: 反也者道之動也 (emphatic)
      Chapter 40 Received: 反者道之動
      The 也 particles add rhetorical weight
      Suggests oral teaching context

  # Geometric vs comparative verb
  形_較:
    guodian: 形
    guodian_pinyin: xíng
    received: 較
    received_pinyin: jiào
    chapters: [2]
    drift: "shape/form -> compare"
    structural_impact: "medium"
    notes: |
      長短相形 (long/short mutually shape each other)
      vs 長短相較 (long/short compare to each other)
      Guodian version emphasizes co-creation
      Received version emphasizes comparison

  # Completion vs leaning
  盈_傾:
    guodian: 盈
    guodian_pinyin: yíng
    received: 傾
    received_pinyin: qīng
    chapters: [2]
    drift: "fill/complete -> lean/incline"
    structural_impact: "medium"
    notes: |
      高下相盈 (high/low mutually fill each other)
      vs 高下相傾 (high/low lean toward each other)
      Guodian emphasizes mutual completion
      Received emphasizes relationship

  # Subtle vs small
  微_小:
    guodian: 微
    guodian_pinyin: wēi
    received: 小
    received_pinyin: xiǎo
    chapters: [32]
    drift: "subtle/imperceptible -> small"
    structural_impact: "medium"
    notes: |
      道恆亡名，樸。雖微... (though subtle/imperceptible)
      vs 道常無名，樸。雖小... (though small)
      微 implies below threshold of perception
      小 is merely dimensional
      Aligns with Chapter 35's imperceptibility principle

# Summary statistics

  pattern: |
    Drift generally moves from:
    - Concrete -> Abstract
    - Relational -> Absolute
    - Dynamic -> Static
    - Conditional -> Categorical

    The Guodian text preserves more operational/structural language
    that matches the pattern-documentation interpretation
