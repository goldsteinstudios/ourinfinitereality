# Operator families: what does the transforming
operators:
  刂:
    pinyin: dāo
    meaning: "blade with handle — scythe geometry"
    domain: "Cutting, arc-sweeping, boundary-making"
    geometry: "The π-operation — curved sweep that traverses what straight lines cannot"
    breakdown: |
      刀 (dāo) = curved stroke (blade) + vertical with hook (two-handed grip)
                = complete scythe geometry: blade ⊥ handle
      刂 = simplified form as right-side radical
    key_insight: |
      NOT a knife (linear push). This is a scythe (arc sweep).
      無為 isn't "non-action" — it's scythe-action vs knife-action.
    substrates_operated: [禾, 貝, 岡]
    results:
      organic: "productive cutting (利, 解)"
      value: "consequent pattern (則)"
      rigid: "failure/hardening (剛)"

  口:
    pinyin: kǒu

    breakdown: |
      反 (fǎn) = 厂 (hǎn, cliff/overhang) + 又 (yòu, right hand)
              = hand against cliff = reaching back = arriving at opposite
    key_insight: |
      反 describes "arriving at opposite," not "= π"
      Mathematics and DDJ are parallel notation systems
      Both needed vocabulary for structural complement
    related:
      返: "反 + 辶 (movement) = reversal in motion → return journey"
      復: "彳 + 复 = step + return → restore/return to root"
      歸: "帚 + 止 = broom + stop → return home"

      obstruction: "harm (害) — blocked void"

  彳:
    pinyin: chì
    meaning: "left footstep — continuous movement"
    domain: "Movement, progression, way-following"
    geometry: "Continuous motion along path"
    breakdown: "pictograph of left step = half of 行 (xíng, walk)"
    substrates_operated: [直+心, 复, 敫, 首]
    results:
      interior: "alignment (德)"
      return: "restoration (復)"
      boundary: "edge-orientation (徼)"
      direction: "way/pattern (道)"

# Algebra verification
algebra_tests:
  - test: "What can 刂 (blade) usefully operate on?"
    predictions:
      - "禾 (grain) → 利 (harvest) ✓"
      - "貝 (value) → 則 (rule) ✓"
      - "岡 (ridge) → 剛 (rigid) ✓ (failure mode)"
      - "水 (water) → ? (can't scythe water — no such character)"
    conclusion: "Blade operates on what can be arc-cut. Water flows around."

  - test: "What can 口 (opening) usefully distribute?"
    predictions:
      - "禾 (grain) → 和 (harmony) ✓"
      - "夕 (darkness) → 名 (name) ✓"
      - "矢 (arrow) → 知 (knowing) ✓"
      - "水 (water) → ? (water doesn't need mouth — already flowing)"
    conclusion: "Opening operates on what needs passage-creation."

summary: |
  The substrate grammar is real. The radicals encode domains.
  The combinations follow rules. Characters ARE equations:
  Character = f(substrate, operator) → structural transformation
