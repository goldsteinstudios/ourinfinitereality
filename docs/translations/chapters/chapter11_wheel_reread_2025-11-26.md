## 輪 (lún) - The Wheel

### Character Analysis

| Character | Components | Structural Reading |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 輪 (lún) | 車 (cart) + 侖 (orderly/arranged) | The arranged rotation, the ordered cycle |

The wheel is the π-operation that never stops.

### The Geometry

```
         ┌─────────────────┐
         │                 │
         │    ○ ← Hub (O)  │
         │   /│\           │
         │  / │ \ Spokes   │
         │ /  │  \ (G)     │
         │────┼────────────│ ← Rim (P)
         │ \  │  /         │
         │  \ │ /          │
         │   \│/           │
         │                 │
         └─────────────────┘

O = Hub (origin, fixed point)
G = Spoke (radius, rigid length)
P = Rim (perimeter, where ground is met)
```

The wheel is:
- **O**: The hub—the anchor that doesn't move relative to the cart
- **G**: The spokes—rigid radii maintaining fixed distance
- **P**: The rim—the perimeter that contacts the ground

### Why It Works

When you push a cart, you're not sliding the cart along the ground. You're rotating the wheel around its hub.

The point of contact with the ground changes continuously, but:
- The hub stays fixed relative to the cart
- Each spoke maintains its length
- The rim sweeps 2π for every full rotation

**The wheel transforms pushing force into rolling motion by making the π-operation continuous.**

## 當其無，有車之用

"In its emptiness, there is the cart's function."

Traditional reading: "The empty space in the hub is what makes the cart useful."

Geometric reading: **The hub must be empty (void at center) for the spokes to rotate around it.**

```
無 at center (O) enables
有 at perimeter (P) to function
```

If the hub were solid, no rotation.
If the hub were absent, no anchor.
The hub must be 無—empty but present—for the 有 (function) to operate.

This is the same principle as the door:
- The hinge point must be fixed (but not solid through) for the door to swing
- The hub must be void (but structurally present) for the wheel to turn

## The Scythe vs. The Wheel

| Feature | Scythe | Wheel |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Arc | π (half-turn per stroke) | 2π (continuous rotation) |
| Anchor | Feet (discrete repositioning) | Hub (fixed to cart) |
| Reset | Step forward, plant again | Continuous (no reset needed) |
| Operation | Discrete arcs | Continuous rotation |

The scythe does π, then resets, then π again.
The wheel does 2π continuously, without reset.

**The wheel is the π-operation that discovered how to not stop.**

## 三十輻共一轂

"Thirty spokes share one hub."

Why thirty? This isn't arbitrary:

- Thirty spokes = one spoke every 12° (360°/30 = 12°)
- Twelve-degree intervals = fine enough for smooth rotation
- All thirty converge on *one* hub

The number documents engineering reality: enough spokes for structural integrity, all sharing a single origin point.

**共一轂** (share one hub) = all radii reference the same O.

This is the geometric requirement: multiple G's can exist, but they must all anchor at the same O for the system to function as a unit.

## The Axle Through the Hub

The hub itself has a hole—for the axle.

```
Cart body
    │
    ▼
═══════════════════  ← Axle
    │
    ▼
   ┌─┐
   │ │ ← Hub (hollow for axle)
   └─┘
    │
    ▼
  Spokes
    │
    ▼
   Rim
```

The axle goes through the hub's emptiness.
The cart's weight transfers through the axle.
The wheel rotates around the axle.

**無 (the hole in the hub) is what connects cart to wheel to ground.**

Without the emptiness, no axle.
Without the axle, no weight transfer.
Without weight transfer, no cart function.

---

## 輪 and 反

If 反 (reversal) is the 2π completion, then 輪 (wheel) is 反 made continuous.

```
反 = one complete cycle (2π)
輪 = unlimited cycles (n × 2π)

反 has a beginning and end
輪 has continuous flow
```

The wheel doesn't "reverse" in the sense of going back. The wheel *continuously cycles*—every point on the rim goes through the same 2π journey repeatedly.

**輪 = 反 without end = perpetual return**

This connects to Chapter 16: 復歸其根 (return to root).
The wheel's rim continuously returns to every position it was before.
Each point on the rim: origin → arc → return → origin → arc → return...

## The Three Demonstrations of Chapter 11

```
輪 (wheel): Hub emptiness enables rotation
埏埴 (pottery): Vessel emptiness enables containing
鑿戶牖 (room): Door/window emptiness enables dwelling
```

All three: **無 at critical point enables 有 to function**

| Object | Where 無 | What 有 |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Wheel | Hub center | Rolling function |
| Pot | Vessel interior | Containing function |
| Room | Door/window openings | Dwelling function |

But the wheel is special:
- The pot's emptiness is static (it just holds)
- The room's emptiness is static (you just enter)
- **The wheel's emptiness enables continuous motion**

The wheel demonstrates: 無 isn't just absence—it's the *anchor point* around which 有 rotates.

## Connection to 道

If 道 is the pattern that generates and sustains all structure, then the wheel is a physical demonstration of 道-mechanics:

```
O (hub/無) = 道 as origin
G (spokes) = 德 as maintained relationship
P (rim) = 萬物 in functional contact with ground
Rotation = the continuous 反 that IS 道's movement
```

The wheel doesn't just *illustrate* the teaching.
**The wheel IS the teaching, built in wood and bronze.**

## Summary

| Element | Wheel Component | Chapter 40 Equivalent |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Fixed origin | Hub (轂) | 無 as generative void |
| Rigid radius | Spokes (輻) | 德 maintaining relationship |
| Functional perimeter | Rim (輪) | 有 in contact with world |
| Continuous operation | Rotation | 反者道之動 |

**The wheel is the π-operation made perpetual.**

Chapter 11 isn't about "emptiness is useful." It's documenting:

> The void at center (O) enables the radius (G) to sweep continuous arcs (P), transforming effort into motion.

This is the engineering manual.
The wheel always knew.

*三十輻共一轂，當其無，有車之用。*

Thirty spokes share one hub.
In its emptiness, there is the cart's function.

**The geometry is the teaching.**
