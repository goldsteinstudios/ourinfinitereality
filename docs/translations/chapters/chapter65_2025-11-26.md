# Chapter 65 — The Law of Subtle Orientation
(Why True Pattern Cannot Be Engineered)
⸻
古之善為道者，非以明民，將以愚之。
The ancients who cohered with the Pattern
did not orient the field by cleverness.
They let its distinctions remain implicit.
民之難治，以其智多。
Disorder arises when local agents over-model.
Too much knowing fractures the field.
故以智治國，國之賊；不以智治國，國之福。
To govern through cleverness
is to introduce noise into coherence.
To govern without it
is to allow the system to self-align.
知此兩者亦稽式。常知稽式，是謂玄德。
To discern these two modes is to trace the structure.
To trace the structure constantly
is to root in subtle recursion —
the virtue of paradox.
玄德深矣遠矣，與物反矣，然後乃至大順。
This recursion runs deep.
It diverges from surface logic.
It counter-orients to align.
Thus, it restores the greater flow.
