## Key Discoveries This Session

1. **Chapter 48 (Subtraction Principle)**
   - 為學日益 vs 為道日損
   - 無為 is destination of recursive subtraction, not starting point

2. **Chapter 25 Rosetta Stone**
   - 道大 as compound (pattern-as-field)
   - Maps to Euler's identity

3. **Project Reorganization**
   - Consolidated scattered files
   - Clean folder structure established

4. **Radical Technology Encoding Thesis**
   - Radicals are compressed engineering manuals from pre-literate technologies
   - 糸 family encodes textile geometry: 經/緯 = 常/可 in material form
   - 維 means both "maintain" and "dimension" because dimensions require threading
   - 道德經 = "Structural Warp of Pattern and Alignment"
   - Each radical family (禾, 氵, 木, 金, etc.) may encode complete technology-knowledge systems

5. **Loom-Axiom Identity**
   - The loom doesn't illustrate the axiom system—it IS the axiom system
   - Warp = 常 (frame-independent invariant), Weft = 可 (frame-dependent variable)
   - Shuttle executes 反 (2π closure) with every pass
   - Fabric only exists at perpendicular intersection (⊥ constraint)
   - 結 (knot) = P-position where flow becomes place
   - Silkworm running transformation algebra before Euler derived it
   - "Notation systems aren't inventions. They're recoveries."

6. **The Focusing Operation (勺)**
   - 勺 encodes concave transformation—distributed field → focal point
   - 的 = 白 + 勺 = brightness + concave = where light focuses
   - 灼 = 火 + 勺 = fire + concave = burning (focused heat)
   - Bronze mirror performs G→P transformation in polished metal
   - 目的 (purpose) = where the eye focuses, optical concentration
   - 豹 (leopard) = beast + concave = the predator that focuses attention

7. **The Forge Transformation Grammar**
   - 淬 = 氵 + 卒 = water + sudden = QUENCH (rate determines state)
   - 退火 = retreating fire = ANNEAL (slow relaxation to equilibrium)
   - Same boundary crossed at different rates → different results
   - 煉 = fire + select = refining separates 無/有
   - 鑄 (cast) = single-step to durable form; 鍛 (forge) = iterative shaping
   - 鋼 (steel) = metal + ridge = 剛 at the right scale
   - Differential hardening = engineering 剛/柔 distribution in single object
   - The forge knows 反 in both directions: snap to position vs oscillate to rest

8. **The Hamon-Chapter 76 Identity**
   - The hamon IS Chapter 76 written in steel
   - Clay is the operator—shapes how quench applies spatially
   - Pure 剛 fails (shatters), pure 柔 fails (useless), gradient succeeds
   - The blade carries its engineering documentation on its surface
   - Every functional system has its "hamon"—the visible 剛/柔 boundary
   - Trees (rings), bones (cortical/trabecular), organizations (middle management)
   - Not "balance between properties" but "correct distribution for function"
   - The smith was performing Chapter 76 every time they applied clay

9. **The 無為 Clay Principle**
   - "You can't force the hamon. You create the conditions for it."
   - That's 無為. That's the whole thing.
   - 輔萬物之自然，而不敢為 = clay assists, doesn't impose
   - Teacher's clay = lesson structure; student's mind = steel
   - Handmade tools teach use; mass-produced tools require manuals
   - Radical families = reader's guides to tool technologies
   - DDJ is navigation system: "you work with X? start with chapter Y"

10. **Technology Index (Lexicon Part 06)**
    - Cross-reference by craft: which chapters for which practitioners
    - 10 technologies mapped: weaving, metal, archery, water, grain, ceramics, wood, optics, cooking, navigation
    - Each technology = one entry point into same geometry
    - Universal failure: pure 剛 or pure 柔; solution always = correct distribution

11. **Hydraulic Origin of Governance**
    - 治 doesn't use water as metaphor for governance—governance IS water management
    - 治 = 氵 + 台 = water + platform = channeling through infrastructure
    - Yu the Great: became ruler BY managing floods, not after
    - 治水 (manage water) is original; 治國 (manage state) is derived
    - Irrigation invented the state, not the reverse
    - 無為 is hydraulic necessity: you literally cannot push water uphill
    - DDJ may be irrigation engineering documentation
    - Every 無為 passage should work as irrigation instruction
