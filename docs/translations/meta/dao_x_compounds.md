# 道X Compounds
## "The Pattern of X" — Section Headers in the Dao De Jing

---

## The Discovery

When the text says 道X, it means: "X is an aspect of 道, and here's how the 道X works."

Each 道X compound functions as a **section header** introducing a domain and its **為** (wéi) — its operation, mechanics, active working.

| **道德** | Title, 38, 51 | Pattern of alignment | The 德 hierarchy and functions |
| **道常** | 37 | Pattern of the implicit | 無為而無不為 (non-acting yet nothing undone) |
| **道沖** | 4 | Pattern of hollowness | 用之或不盈 (use without filling) |
| **道隱** | 41 | Pattern of hiddenness | 無名 (nameless substrate) |
| **道紀** | 14 | Pattern's ordering-thread | The continuous substrate |
| **道之動** | 40 | Pattern's movement | 反者 (wraparound) |
| **道之用** | 40 | Pattern's function | 弱者 (yielding) |
| **道之華** | 38 | Pattern's flowering | Mere display vs. substance |
| **道之為物** | 21 | Pattern-as-thing | 唯恍唯惚 (indistinct) |

| **天之道** | 9, 77, 81 | Heaven's pattern | Withdrawal after completion |
| **為道** | 48 | Practicing pattern | 日損 (daily decrease) |
| **善為道者** | 65 | Those who enact pattern well | Non-enlightening governance |
| **明道** | 41 | Bright pattern | 若昧 (appears dark) |
| **進道** | 41 | Advancing pattern | 若退 (appears retreating) |
| **夷道** | 41 | Level pattern | 若纇 (appears rough) |

### The 為 Pattern

Each 道X introduces an aspect, then documents its **為** — what it does, how it operates:

| Compound | 為 (Operation) |
|----------|----------------|
| 道大 | Overflows → extends → wraps around (sphere proof) |
| 道常 | Non-acts yet completes everything |
| 道沖 | Used without filling |
| 道之動 | Wraparound (continuous extension arriving at origin) |
| 道之用 | Yielding |
| 道生 | Generates 一→二→三→萬物 |

## Structural Groupings

### Aspects of 道

| Compound | Aspect |
|----------|--------|
| 道大 | Infinity (unbounded field) |
| 道常 | Implicitness (frame-independent) |
| 道沖 | Hollowness (functional void) |
| 道隱 | Hiddenness (substrate invisibility) |
| 道德 | Alignment (pattern-following) |

### Operations of 道

| Compound | Operation |
|----------|-----------|
| 道之動 | Movement (wraparound) |
| 道之用 | Function (yielding) |
| 道生 | Generation (emanation sequence) |
| 道法 | Self-recursion (self-grounding) |

### Appearances of 道 (若 paradoxes)

| Compound | From Aligned Frame | From Misaligned Frame |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 明道 | Bright | Appears dark (若昧) |
| 進道 | Advancing | Appears retreating (若退) |
| 夷道 | Level | Appears rough (若纇) |

### Frame-Specific Patterns

| Compound | Frame | Pattern |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 天之道 | Heaven | Withdrawal after completion |
| 大道 | Totality | Floods everywhere without claiming |
| 為道 | Practice | Daily subtraction |

## The Grammar

**道X** = "Here is aspect X of pattern. Here is how it works:"

This means:
- 道大 isn't "the Dao is great" — it's "The pattern of infinity: [proof follows]"
- 道德 isn't "the Way and Virtue" — it's "The pattern of alignment: [dynamics follow]"
- 道常 isn't "the constant Dao" — it's "The pattern of implicitness: [operation follows]"

The text is organized as **aspect introductions followed by mechanics**.

## Implications for Translation

When you encounter 道X:
1. Recognize it as a compound (section header)
2. Read what follows as "how 道X works"
3. Don't separate into "the Dao" + adjective

When you encounter X道:
1. May be different construction (e.g., 天之道 = "heaven's pattern")
2. Check if possessive or compound
