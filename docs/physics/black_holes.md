## The Thesis

Black holes are what happens when rotation can no longer maintain itself.

The event horizon is a boundary: inside, even light cannot circulate fast enough to escape. The singularity is the limit case — where the mathematics predicts infinite density, which really means the model breaks down.

Black holes aren't anomalies. They're boundary conditions. They show where the pattern meets its limit.
