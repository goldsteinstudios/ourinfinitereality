# The Physics

*Energy, spacetime, quantum. Rotation all the way down.*

---

You came through the door marked with a wheel. The spokes connect to the hub. The hub stays empty.

This is what energy is. Not a substance that flows, but a pattern that rotates. Every form of energy — kinetic, potential, thermal, electromagnetic — is rotation at a different scale.

## What's Here

- **[Energy](energy.md)** — The central thesis: energy is rotation.

- **[Spacetime](spacetime.md)** — Time as recursion. Space as the room for rotation.

- **[Quantum](quantum.md)** — Measurement as frame selection. Why observation "collapses" superposition.

- **[Black Holes](black_holes.md)** — Where rotation fails. The boundary condition.

- **[Formalism](formalism.md)** — The mathematics. How this maps to physics notation.

---

## The Hub Document

- **[Energy Is Rotation](../../framework/physics_synthesis_hub.md)** — The complete physics synthesis.

## The Connection

The Dao De Jing describes a wheel:

> 三十輻共一轂，當其無，有車之用。
> Thirty spokes share one hub. In its emptiness is the function of the wheel.

A galaxy is this. An atom is this. A photon is this. Rotation around a center that doesn't fill.
