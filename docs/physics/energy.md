## The Thesis

All forms of energy are rotational patterns at different scales:

- Kinetic energy: rotation of position
- Potential energy: stored rotation (spring tension, gravitational wells)
- Thermal energy: random micro-rotations
- Electromagnetic energy: rotating fields
- Mass-energy: rotation so tight it appears stationary

Energy isn't a substance. It's a pattern.
