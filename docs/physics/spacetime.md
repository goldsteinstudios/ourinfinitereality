# Spacetime

*Time as recursion. Space as the room for rotation.*

## Core Document

- **[Time as Recursion](../framework/time_recursion_synthesis.md)**

## The Thesis

Time isn't a river. It's the counting of recursive cycles.

Space isn't a container. It's the room that rotation requires.

Both emerge from the same structural necessity: for stable patterns to persist in an infinite reality, they must circulate around hollow centers. Time is the count of circulations. Space is the geometry they require.

*More spacetime documentation is in development.*
