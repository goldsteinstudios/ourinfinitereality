## The Thesis

Measurement doesn't "collapse" anything. It selects a frame.

Before measurement, a quantum system exists in superposition — all possible states coexisting. Measurement doesn't destroy the other states. It chooses which relationship between observer and system becomes definite.

The "mystery" of quantum mechanics dissolves when you realize that the observer isn't outside the system looking in. The observer is part of the circulation.
