## The Connection

The five operators — e, i, π, 1, 0 — connected through Euler's identity:

**e^(iπ) + 1 = 0**

This isn't just beautiful mathematics. It's the formula for circulation around a hollow center. Growth (e), rotation (i), closure (π), locality (1), void (0).

This section maps the structural framework onto standard physics and mathematics notation.
