# Embodied Pattern

*What the pattern feels like.*

## Under Development

This page will explore how the structural pattern shows up in embodied experience:

- Movement and stillness as complementary, not opposite
- The feeling of rotation around an empty center
- How 無/有 (absence/presence) oscillates in sensation

For now, the best entry points are the chapters that describe physical objects:

- [Chapter 11 — Void and Function](../translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md) — wheel, pot, room
- [Chapter 5 — The Bellows](../translations/chapters/chapter05_2025-11-26.md) — breathing apparatus
- [Chapter 8 — Water](../translations/chapters/chapter08_2025-11-26.md) — flowing and settling

Read them as instructions, not descriptions.
