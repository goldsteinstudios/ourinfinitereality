# The Practice

*A walk, a breath, a wheel turning*

---

You came through the door marked "Practice." Good instinct.

Understanding the pattern intellectually is one thing. Feeling it in your body is another. This section is about the second kind of knowing—the kind that doesn't need words, that lives in movement and breath and the way your weight shifts when you walk.

## What's Here (and What's Coming)

This section is under development. The pattern shows up in practice as clearly as it shows up in physics or ancient texts—but documenting embodied knowledge requires a different approach than documenting ideas.

What's planned:

**The Walk** — A specific practice. How to walk in a way that demonstrates the pattern to yourself. Not mystical. Not complicated. Just walking, with attention to what walking actually is.

**Breath and Circulation** — The bellows of Chapter 5. How breathing is rotation around an empty center. How you can feel the 無/有 oscillation in your own chest.

**The Wheel** — What it feels like to be a spoke. How stable motion around a hollow hub translates into lived experience.

## For Now

The closest thing to practice documentation currently lives in:

**[Chapter 11 — Void and Function](../translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md)** — The wheel, the pot, the room. Read it slowly. Then look at an actual wheel.

**[Chapter 5 — The Bellows](../translations/chapters/chapter05_2025-11-26.md)** — Then breathe.

**[Chapter 8 — Water](../translations/chapters/chapter08_2025-11-26.md)** — Then pour water into a glass and watch what it does.

The text IS practice instruction, if you let it be.

## The Principle

You don't learn to swim by reading about buoyancy. You get in the water.

But once you've been in the water, reading about buoyancy makes sense in a way it didn't before. The concepts land in a body that already knows something.

Same here. Read the physics synthesis, then go for a walk. Read the Dao De Jing translations, then sit with an empty bowl. Let the concepts find the body that already knows.

## The Other Doors

**[The Pattern →](../pattern/)** — The physics, geometry, mathematics

**[The Text →](../text/)** — The ancient field guide

**[The Story →](../story/)** — How this began, what it isn't

*Enter anywhere. The center is everywhere.*
