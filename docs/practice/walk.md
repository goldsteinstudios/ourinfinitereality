# The Walk

*A specific practice. Not mystical. Just walking.*

## Under Development

This page will document a walking practice that demonstrates the recursive structural pattern in your own body.

For now, read [Chapter 11 — Void and Function](../../translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md) and then go for a walk. Notice:

- The way each step creates empty space for the next
- The oscillation between left and right
- The stillness that moves through you while you move through space

You don't need instructions. You already know how to walk.
