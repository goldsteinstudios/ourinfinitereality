# Breath and Circulation

*The bellows of Chapter 5. Rotation around an empty center.*

## Under Development

This page will explore breathing as a direct experience of the pattern:

- 虛而不屈 — Empty but not collapsing
- 動而愈出 — Moving and ever emerging
- The 無/有 oscillation happening in your chest right now

For now, read [Chapter 5 — The Bellows](../translations/chapters/chapter05_2025-11-26.md), then sit quietly and breathe. Notice:

- The space that creates the breath
- The rhythm that doesn't require your attention
- The way emptying creates fullness

The text describes a bellows. Your chest is a bellows.
