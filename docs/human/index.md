# The Human

*Consciousness, choice, story. The pattern in experience.*

---

You came through the door marked with breath — the wave that goes out and comes back, over and over, without you deciding.

The pattern shows up in physics and trees. But it also shows up in you. In how you think, how you choose, how you tell stories about who you are.

## What's Here

- **[Practice](practice.md)** — Embodied experience. Walking, breathing, sensing the pattern.

- **[Story](story.md)** — How this project began. What it isn't.

## The Connection

Chapter 5 describes a bellows:

> 天地之間，其猶橐籥乎？虛而不屈，動而愈出。
> Between heaven and earth — isn't it like a bellows?
> Empty but not collapsing, moving and ever emerging.

Your chest is a bellows. Your consciousness is a bellows. Empty at the center, but not collapsing. Moving, and ever emerging.
