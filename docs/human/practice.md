# Practice

*Embodied experience. The pattern in the body.*

---

Understanding the pattern intellectually is one thing. Feeling it is another.

## Entry Points

- **[The Walk](../practice/walk.md)** — A specific practice. Not mystical. Just walking.

- **[Embodied](../practice/embodied.md)** — What the pattern feels like in the body.

- **[Breath](../practice/breath.md)** — The bellows of Chapter 5.

## From the Text

The closest thing to practice instruction in the translations:

- **[Chapter 11 — Void and Function](../translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md)** — The wheel, the pot, the room.

- **[Chapter 5 — The Bellows](../translations/chapters/chapter05_2025-11-26.md)** — Then breathe.

- **[Chapter 8 — Water](../translations/chapters/chapter08_2025-11-26.md)** — Then pour water and watch.

The text IS practice instruction, if you let it be.

## The Principle

You don't learn to swim by reading about buoyancy. You get in the water.

But once you've been in the water, reading about buoyancy makes sense in a way it didn't before.

Same here.
