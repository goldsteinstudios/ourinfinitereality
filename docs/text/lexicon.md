# The Lexicon

*Terms as technology. Each character encodes operational logic.*

---

## Reading the Lexicon

The lexicon documents how individual characters function as structural operators, not as "words with meanings." Each entry shows:

- The character's semantic range
- Its structural function in the text
- Cross-references to related operators
