# Character Algebra

*The characters compute. Radicals encode technology.*

## The Thesis

Chinese characters aren't arbitrary symbols. The radicals — the component parts — encode specific technologies and operations from the ancient world. Understanding these encodings reveals the text as technical documentation, not poetry.

## Core Documents

- **[Radical Technology Encoding](../../translations/meta/radical_technology_encoding_2025-11-27.md)**
  How radicals map to ancient technologies: forge, loom, water engineering.

- **[Forge Transformation Grammar](../../translations/meta/forge_transformation_grammar_2025-12-07.md)**
  金 (metal) and 火 (fire) radicals encode transformation operations.

- **[Radical Families](../../translations/meta/radical_families_grain_blade_2025-12-07.md)**
  禾 (grain), 刀 (blade), 糸 (silk) — Family groupings reveal operational categories.

## Case Studies

- **[Scythe Not Knife](../../translations/meta/scythe_not_knife_2025-11-27.md)**
  利 means "harvest-efficient," not "sharp." The agricultural reading.

- **[Loom Axiom Identity](../../translations/meta/loom_axiom_identity_2025-11-27.md)**
  經 (warp thread) as "invariant structure" — why "classic" is a mistranslation.

- **[Focusing Operation](../../translations/meta/focusing_operation_2025-11-27.md)**
  精 as the operation of bringing something into resolution.
