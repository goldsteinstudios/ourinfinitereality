# Archaeology

*The oldest copies. What the bamboo actually says.*

## The Guodian Discovery

In 1993, a tomb was discovered in Guodian, China containing bamboo slips dating to approximately 300 BCE — making them the oldest known copies of portions of the Dao De Jing. These predate the received text by roughly 400 years.

The differences are significant. Not minor scribal variations, but structural differences that change interpretation.

## Bundle Inventories

The Guodian manuscripts were found in three distinct bundles, possibly representing different collecting or organizing principles:

- **[Guodian Bundle A](../../translations/archaeology/guodian_bundle_a_inventory.md)**
  Chapters focused on 道 and cosmological structure.

- **[Guodian Bundle B](../../translations/archaeology/guodian_bundle_b_inventory.md)**
  Chapters focused on 德 and alignment.

- **[Guodian Bundle C](../../translations/archaeology/guodian_bundle_c_inventory.md)**
  Chapters focused on governance and application.

## Analysis

- **[Cross-Reference Report](../../translations/archaeology/guodian_cross_reference_report.md)**
  Character-by-character comparison between Guodian and received text.

- **[Section Break Analysis](../../translations/archaeology/guodian_section_break_analysis.md)**
  How the original scribes marked section divisions — and what that reveals about chapter boundaries.

## Why This Matters

The Guodian manuscripts:

1. Confirm the text's antiquity (definitely 300+ BCE)
2. Show which elements are oldest vs. later additions
3. Reveal organizational principles lost in later compilations
4. Provide variant readings that clarify ambiguous passages

Chapters marked "✓ Guodian" in the translations have been verified against these manuscripts.
