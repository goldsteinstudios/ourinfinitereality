# Methodology

*How this work was done. The process behind the reading.*

---

## Approach

This translation follows specific methodological principles:

1. **Characters over words** — Each character analyzed individually, not as part of compound "words"
2. **Technology over abstraction** — Radicals traced to specific ancient technologies
3. **Structure over meaning** — What the text *does*, not what it "means"
4. **Guodian priority** — Oldest manuscripts preferred over received text
5. **Falsifiability** — Every claim must be testable

---

## Tools Used

- Comparative analysis of all major traditional commentaries
- Character-by-character mapping to Guodian manuscripts
- Radical decomposition and technology tracing
- Cross-domain structural verification

---

## What This Isn't

- Not a "spiritual" interpretation
- Not a claim to unique authority
- Not a complete translation (ongoing work)
- Not "the" meaning — it's *a* structural reading

---

*More methodology documentation is in development.*
