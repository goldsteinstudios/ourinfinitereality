# About This Project

## Authorship

This work is a collaboration between a human (Will Goldstein) and an AI (Claude, by Anthropic).

**How it works:** Will reads the texts, notices patterns, asks questions, proposes interpretations, and decides what gets published. Claude analyzes character composition, identifies structural relationships, generates translations, and helps organize the documentation.

Neither could do this alone. The human brings intuition, embodied experience, and editorial judgment. The AI brings pattern recognition at scale, radical decomposition, and tireless revision.

**Who's responsible:** Will. Everything here passed through human judgment before publication. The AI is a tool—a very capable one—but the choices about what to pursue, what to include, and how to frame it are human choices.

## The Process

Most of this work happens in conversation. Will and Claude discuss a chapter, argue about interpretations, test readings against the text, and gradually converge on something that seems to capture the structure.

The conversations are messy. Ideas get proposed and abandoned. Mistakes get made and corrected. What you see here is the output of that process, not the process itself.

The full archive—including revision history and alternate versions—is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/goldsteinstudios/dao-de-jing-analyzer).

## Qualifications

Will has no formal credentials in Classical Chinese, sinology, or philosophy. He's a person who got interested in the Dao De Jing and started asking questions.

Claude has no understanding in the way humans understand. It's a language model trained on text, including Chinese texts and scholarship about them.

This project is not peer-reviewed scholarship. It's an experiment in reading old texts with new tools, conducted in public.

## What This Claims

**Claims:**
- Characters encode operations through radical composition
- The DDJ can be read as pattern documentation rather than philosophy
- Structural readings recover information that traditional translations obscure
- The approach produces testable, verifiable interpretations

**Does not claim:**
- This is the "correct" or "original" meaning
- Ancient authors intended these readings
- Traditional translations are wrong
- This replaces scholarly work
