# The Living

*Trees, cells, ecosystems. Growth around empty centers.*

You came through the door marked with tree rings. Good instinct.

Living systems don't build from foundations up. They grow outward from centers that stay empty — the hollow pith of a tree, the nucleus organizing but not filling the cell, the keystone species that structures an ecosystem by what it doesn't consume.

## What's Here

- **[Plants](plants.md)** — Trees, vines, root systems. How plant architecture demonstrates the pattern.

## The Connection

Chapter 11 of the Dao De Jing describes this directly:

> 三十輻共一轂，當其無，有車之用。
> Thirty spokes share one hub. In its emptiness is the function of the wheel.

A tree is this. Growth rings radiating from a center that stays hollow. The pith doesn't fill — it organizes.
