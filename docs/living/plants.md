*Growth around empty centers.*

## The Pattern in Trees

A tree is a structural proof. Cut one open and you see the geometry directly: growth rings radiating from a center that stays empty.

The pith — the central core — doesn't fill. It organizes. The tree grows outward from what it isn't.

## The Hollow Center

Every vascular plant exhibits this pattern:

1. **Growth radiates outward** from a central axis
2. **The center stays empty** (or becomes hollow as the plant matures)
3. **Stability comes from circulation**, not from filling

This isn't metaphor. It's anatomy.
