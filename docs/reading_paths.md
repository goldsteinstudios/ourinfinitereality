# Reading Paths

*Different doors into the same room*

---

Not everyone arrives with the same questions. These paths organize the material for different starting points. All paths eventually converge—the pattern is the same, only the angle of approach differs.

## The Casual Reader
**30 minutes • First taste**

You're curious but not committed. Start here:

1. **[Homepage](./index.md)** — The origin story and core insight (5 min)
2. **[Chapter 11: Void and Function](./translations/chapters/chapter11_2025-11-27.md)** — The wheel, pot, and room. Function lives in emptiness. (10 min)
3. **[Chapter 25: Spherical Recursion](./translations/chapters/chapter25_sphere_proof_2025-12-01.md)** — Where the text describes its own recursive structure (15 min)

*If this resonates, continue to the Physicist or Sinologist path.*

---

## The Sinologist
**2-3 hours • Character-level analysis**

You read Chinese, or you want to understand how radicals encode meaning. The claim: these characters are diagrams, not poetry.

1. **[Lexicon Introduction](./translations/lexicon/00_lexicon_introduction.md)** — How the character algebra works
2. **[Chapter 1: The Coordinate System](./translations/chapters/chapter01_2025-12-07.md)** — 道可道非常道 decomposed structurally
3. **[Substrate Families](./translations/lexicon/01_substrate_families.md)** — The radicals that encode origins and gradients
4. **[Operator Families](./translations/lexicon/02_operator_families.md)** — The radicals that encode transformations
5. **[Guodian Bundle A](./translations/archaeology/guodian_bundle_a_inventory.md)** — Archaeological validation from ~300 BCE
6. **[Cross-Reference Report](./translations/archaeology/guodian_cross_reference_report.md)** — What the bamboo slips confirm

*Key test: Does 治 (govern) = water + platform make more sense as "channel flow" than "rule over"?*

---

## The Physicist
**2-3 hours • Mathematical framework**

You want the formal structure. Does this model make testable predictions?

1. **[Recursive Structural Model](./translations/meta/recursive_structural_model.md)** — O → G → P → O recursion cycle
2. **[Geometry: The Paradox Sphere](./framework/geometry.md)** — Π₀ construction from hyperbolic rotation
3. **[Falsification Criteria](./framework/falsification.md)** — What would disprove RSM
4. **[Academic Parallels](./framework/academic_parallels.md)** — Wheeler, Bohm, Rovelli and 15 other frameworks
5. **[Scale Invariance](./essays/scale_invariance.md)** — Why critical exponents are irrational
6. **[Euler and the Tao](./essays/euler_tao.md)** — e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 as structural proof

*Key test: Does the model predict anything that standard physics doesn't? See falsification criteria.*

---

## The Skeptic
**1 hour • Show me the evidence**

You suspect this is pattern-matching dressed as insight. Fair. Here's the strongest counter-evidence to that concern:

1. **[Falsification Criteria](./framework/falsification.md)** — Specific predictions that would break the model
2. **[Academic Parallels](./framework/academic_parallels.md)** — 18 frameworks that converge on similar structures
3. **[Guodian Bundle A](./translations/archaeology/guodian_bundle_a_inventory.md)** — 300 BCE manuscript evidence
4. **[Cross-Reference Report](./translations/archaeology/guodian_cross_reference_report.md)** — What changed between ancient and received texts
5. **[Chapter 25: Spherical Recursion](./translations/chapters/chapter25_sphere_proof_2025-12-01.md)** — The Rosetta Stone chapter

*Key question: If this is just pareidolia, why do the Guodian manuscripts—predating all philosophical commentary—show the same structural emphasis?*

---

## The Biologist
**1-2 hours • Living systems**

You work with organisms. Does the pattern show up in your domain?

1. **[Plant Axioms](./framework/plant_axioms.md)** — 10 testable predictions about growth surfaces
2. **[Chapter 6: The Valley Spirit](./translations/chapters/chapter06_2025-11-26.md)** — Emptiness that receives
3. **[Chapter 76: Soft and Hard](./translations/chapters/chapter76_2025-11-26.md)** — Flexibility and persistence
4. **[Energy as Orbital Density](./essays/energy_orbital_density.md)** — Metabolic scaling and quantum biology

*Key test: Do meristems and cambium behave as G surfaces—boundaries where recursion updates?*
