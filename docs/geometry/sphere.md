## The Thesis

Paradoxes aren't contradictions. They're poles.

Being and non-being, one and many, same and different — these apparent opposites resolve when you see them as positions on a sphere rather than points on a line.

On a line, opposites exclude each other. On a sphere, opposites are connected by the surface between them. You can walk from one to the other without contradiction.

The "center" of the sphere — the paradoxical point where all opposites meet — can't be occupied. But it organizes everything around it.
