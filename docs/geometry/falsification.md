## The Principle

Any genuine framework must be falsifiable. If nothing could prove it wrong, it's not a framework — it's a belief.

This reading makes specific, testable claims:

1. The geometric structure described should appear in physics
2. The characters encode specific technologies (verifiable against archaeology)
3. The Guodian manuscripts should show earlier, purer versions of the structure
4. Cross-domain mappings should be consistent, not ad hoc

If any of these fail, the reading fails.

## Not Falsified By

- "Other people read it differently" — irrelevant
- "Traditional readings disagree" — irrelevant
- "It feels wrong" — irrelevant

Falsification requires showing structural inconsistency or empirical failure, not disagreement.
