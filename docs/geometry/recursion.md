# Recursion

*Scale invariance. The same pattern at every level.*

## The Thesis

The structure contains itself.

Any point on the periphery can become the center of a new system. What orbits around one center can itself become the center that other things orbit around.

This is why the same patterns show up across such different domains. Not because someone is projecting a metaphor onto everything — but because anything that persists has to use this geometry.
