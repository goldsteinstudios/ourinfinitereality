# Symbols

*The ouroboros, the wheel, the tree, the void.*

## Under Development

This page will explore recurring symbols across cultures:

- **The Ouroboros** — Circulation that sustains itself by consuming its own output
- **The Wheel** — Function is the emptiness at the hub
- **The Tree** — Growth rings around a hollow center
- **The Void** — Emptiness that organizes, not absence that lacks

Why these images persist across cultures that had no contact with each other.
