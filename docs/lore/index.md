# The Lore

*Myth and meaning, reread.*

---

You came through the door marked with an ouroboros — the snake eating its own tail.

The oldest stories we tell aren't random. They encode the same patterns that show up in physics and biology and ancient technical manuals. Not because ancient people were secretly physicists, but because the patterns are real, and humans have always noticed them.

## The Connection

The ouroboros shows the pattern directly: circulation that maintains itself by consuming its own output. The end feeds the beginning. The structure sustains itself through its own activity.

Every culture has found ways to encode this. The details differ. The structure doesn't.
